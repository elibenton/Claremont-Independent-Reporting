aS'The Threat You Don\xe2\x80\x99t Know About'
p3
aVThis week, we witnessed yet another government shutdown. For Democrats, Republicans, and virtually all in between, the scenes on the floor of the House and the Senate provide the latest evidence of the dangerous incompetence of our elected government. Some have said that this legislative ineptitude is the greatest threat our country faces, trumping even national security concerns.\u000aThe greatest threat to the freedom of everyday Americans, however, does not come from Congress. Neither does it come from abroad\u2014an ascendant China or a flood of immigrants\u2014or even from an erratic president. It is an insidious internal force that drains our democracy of meaning and destroys our political institutions, even as it entrenches the power of a cadre of political elites and cheapens the tremendous progress our nation has made toward universal suffrage. It is the administrative state.\u000aThe administrative state\u2014the complex arrangement of agencies, sub-agencies, and independent commissions that comprise the executive branch of our government\u2014dangerously consolidates government power in the hands of an unelected, unaccountable, and unrepresentative educated elite, marginalizing our constitutional government in the process.\u000aAs any high-school civics teacher will tell you, the executive branch is tasked with the execution of federal law, meaning that the executive branch, with a few particular exceptions described in the Constitution, may not act without an explicit directive from the people\u2019s representatives in Congress: a bill. The object of separating the executive and legislative powers in this way was to protect the people from tyranny. By keeping \u201cthe purse and the sword\u201d separate, a demagogue elevated to the presidency could not enforce his arbitrary will upon the people without the support of their representatives in Congress, or vice versa.\u000aThe administrative state entirely, deliberately, and dangerously undermines this careful design. For the most part, each of the more than 250 departments, agencies, and sub-agencies may issue rules with the binding force of law, launch investigations into violations of those rules, judge whether their own investigations have discovered violations of the aforementioned rules, and penalize members of the public for those violations\u2014all without the interposition of a federal judge, a specific mandate from Congress, or the due process guaranteed by the U.S. Constitution. Taken together, these powerful fiefdoms, from the Environmental Protection Agency to the Federal Communications Commission, control virtually every aspect of American life. \u000aEven as these administrative agencies routinely serve as judge, jury, and executioner for members of the public, they are unelected, unrepresentative, and unaccountable. More than 98 percent of federal civilian employees are unelected; instead, they are chosen through the civil service process, which insulates them even from indirect electoral accountability with generous tenure guarantees, regular salary increases, and near-complete protection from termination. Compared to a typical member of the public, the average federal employee is better paid, better educated, and far less likely to be a woman or a person of color. Tellingly, the advocates of the administrative state long have regarded these features to be its principal benefit; to avoid giving the \u201crigidly unphilosophical\u201d public a hand in its own governance, Woodrow Wilson advocated handing \u201clarge powers and unhampered discretion\u201d to unelected administrators instead.1\u000aWorse, Congress and the courts have bowed to the administrative state. The courts steadfastly refuse to defend Americans dragged before partial administrative law judges and tyrannical federal commissions, on the grounds that the administrative state is simply too large and too essential to modern life to subject to meaningful limits. Meanwhile, individual congressmen, long content to surrender difficult decisions to a faceless bureaucracy and thereby minimize scrutiny from voters, have renounced almost entirely their role in policymaking. While Congress quibbles over three weeks of government funding, agencies issue thousands of pages of regulations, conduct countless adjudicatory proceedings, and pile more demands upon the American people than they could read in an entire lifetime. Only the largest corporations can afford to keep up; in fact, they often help agencies draft their rules, trading their compliance for regulations that destroy their competitors.2\u000aThe rise of such unchecked power ought to concern all Americans, regardless of their political orientation. As more power accrues to unelected career bureaucrats, our democracy loses its meaning. Why vote at all when our legislators have only a marginal effect on government policy\u2014when even dramatic shifts in the partisan composition of Congress yields little to no change for voters? Surrendering our responsibility to govern to the well-born and well-educated members of the administrative state will weaken and ultimately extinguish our capacity to rule ourselves. As Philip Hamburger has explained, administrative power \u201caccustoms an otherwise self-governing people to a regime of potentially pervasive control, and it thereby gradually deprives them of their capacity for self-rule.\u201d\u000aOne of the greatest blessings of modern times is the institution of regular, constitutional government for so many nations of the world. What a shame it would be for the United States, so long a shining beacon of political freedom, to surrender its liberties to the \u201cexperts\u201d and know-betters, rather than letting every man cast his vote, and having it matter.

aS'Pomona Adds Social Justice to Stats Curriculum'
p7
aVThis spring semester, the general Introduction to Statistics (MATH058) course at Pomona College has a new addition to its curriculum\u2014the exploration of social justice issues. Taught by visiting assistant professor Omayra Ortega, a Pomona alumna, the class uses \u201cexamples from social justice literature [to] help explain the statistics.\u201d \u000aThis course is the only general introductory statistics class offered at Pomona. Other introductory classes have a specific applied focus, like Biostatistics, Economic Statistics, or Statistics for Politics and International Relations.\u000aThe new additions to the Introduction to Statistics syllabus were advertised last semester via posters placed around campus emphasizing the social justice aspect of the course.\u000a\u201cConcepts from statistics will be applied to current data relating to issues in social justice using statistical computer software.\u201d \u000aGiven the limited time available in a semester, Introduction to Statistics\u2019s emphasis on social justice contrasts with courses like Economic Statistics, or Statistics for Politics and International Relations, which focus on statistical concepts and tools. The syllabus for Statistics for Politics shows no mandatory reading on issues unrelated to statistics, with political reading only listed as \u201crecommended reading.\u201d \u000aIn contrast, according to the course syllabus obtained by the Independent, social justice is central to Ortega\u2019s class: \u201cThe main goal of this course [Math 058] is to enhance your analytical and statistical skills while exploring topics in social justice.\u201d\u000aA component of the class also includes mandatory journals submitted every week that \u201cshould contain reflections on both the statistical and social justice topics covered.\u201d \u000aStudents at Pomona seemed to disagree with the course\u2019s objectives. One mathematics student told the Independent, under the condition of anonymity, that \u201c[if] you are studying math influenced by any ideology\u2026 it\u2019s not math. The beauty of math is that it is objective \u2013 it holds true regardless of culture, politics and so on. If you\u2019re teaching social justice in a math class, you\u2019re not teaching math.\u201d\u000a\u201cI\u2019ll never take a class like that [Ortega\u2019s statistics class],\u201d he added. \u000aOther mathematics students had similar reactions.\u000a\u201cI don\u2019t find politics being mixed into my math class a positive thing because [the] campus is political enough as is\u2026Additionally, the idea of social justice pushed by the liberal professors tend to center around ideas of justice based on their liberal principles,\u201d another student told the Independent.\u000a\u201cThis class will probably not be nonpartisan, and as a conservative leaning moderate who disagrees with many liberal ideas\u2026I don\u2019t think think this class will fit in with my idea of social justice, [which is] why it [the class\u2019s curriculum] makes me uncomfortable.\u201d\u000aThe Independent reached out to Ortega and the math department, inquiring about the details of the social justice topics discussed in her class, and why they are important to learning statistics. We have yet to receive a response.

aS'Colleges Decline to Commit to Protecting Controversial Speakers'
p11
aVFollowing the shutdown of conservative speaker Heather Mac Donald by a crowd of students last spring, the Independent has discovered that none of the Claremont Colleges have adjusted their policies in order to protect controversial speakers on campus.\u000aAfter Heather Mac Donald\u2014a conservative scholar who opposes the Black Lives Matter movement\u2014attempted to speak at Claremont McKenna College\u2019s (CMC) Athenaeum last April, an angry mob of student protesters forced her to be hustled out the back door of the venue. The protest, enabled in part by ineffectual campus security, garnered national attention, which ultimately drove the college to penalize ten of its students. Most of the approximately 170 protesters, however, came from the other Claremont Colleges\u2014all of which either have declined to investigate or have refused to punish their students for violating campus policy at that event. \u000aAcross the country, other campuses have grappled with the financial burden of protecting controversial speakers. From UC Berkeley\u2019s expensive experience with Milo Yiannopoulos in February\u2014where rioting caused more than $100,000 worth of damage to the University\u2014to Ben Shapiro at the University of Utah, it is clear that freedom of speech for controversial speakers\u2014especially conservatives\u2014now requires significant financial commitments.\u000aWhen asked if any of the five Claremont Colleges\u2014which includes Pomona College, Claremont McKenna College, Harvey Mudd College, Scripps College, and Pitzer College\u2014had altered their policies surrounding preventing disruptive crowds, each of the colleges independently confirmed that they had not adjusted their policies, and three of the five stated that event organizers were responsible for procuring funding for security. \u000aOnly Claremont McKenna and Scripps College indicated the possibility that they would cover the cost of security for an event. When asked how CMC planned to handle the potential financial burden of controversial speakers, Peter Hong, Associate Vice President for Public Affairs and Communications, told the Independent: \u201cWe consider covering extraordinary costs for any speaker.\u201d\u000aLikewise, Scripps College\u2019s Associate Director of Media and Public Relations, Karen Bergh, indicated to the Independent that its administration provides some resources for event security, but that the financial burden of a speaker was one of the criteria that the administration reviews before allowing a speaker on campus: \u000a\u201cScripps College has not introduced new policies, rather, in response to community concerns, we\u2019ve ensured that event organizers are aware of the resources available to them to provide a safe, secure environment for all events. Requests for the use of campus venues are reviewed on a case by case basis and according to a range of criteria, including cost. We remain committed to providing a community forum for an exchange of ideas on a wide range of topics.\u201d \u000aWhen the Independent inquired after who assessed the events and the specific criteria used to evaluate speakers, Ms. Bergh declined to comment further.\u000aThough Pomona College, Harvey Mudd College, and Pitzer College all stated that event organizers were required to provide the funds for their own security, they indicated that some degree of assistance might be provided by the campuses\u2019 security officers. \u000aMary Lou Ferry, Pomona College\u2019s Vice President and Chief Communications Officer, indicated that event sponsors are expected to cover security costs, but told the Independent: \u201cThe ASPC [Associated Students of Pomona College] has a security fund that will cover up to three campus safety officers for up to four hours for any student event. The student group that is sponsoring the speaker needs to apply ahead of time to receive that funding. They do so as part of their event planning process.\u201d\u000aIt is unclear that ASPC would be willing to provide said funding for conservative speakers. From seeking to erase Columbus Day to withdrawing funding from parties they deem offensive, ASPC tends to back progressive causes. \u000aHarvey Mudd College\u2019s Chief Communications Officer, Timothy Hussey, explained a similar policy to the Independent:\u000a\u201cEvent sponsors are responsible for the costs associated with hosting an event on campus,\u201d stated Hussey, \u201cWe encourage student organizations interested in sponsoring events to coordinate with ASHMC and the Division of Student Affairs as needed to assess event-specific details and to partner with Campus Safety on security-related issues and costs.\u201d\u000aThe same is true at Pitzer College. \u000a\u201cAs with all speakers invited to the Pitzer campus, the College and the event sponsor work with Campus Safety and the speaker\u2019s security team to ensure the safety of our community members and campus.\u201d stated Anna Chang, Senior Director for Communications and Media Relations at Pitzer College.\u000a\u201cThe event sponsor, whether faculty or student group such as the Student Senate, is responsible for costs associated with hosting the event, including travel, speaker fees, catering, security, etc.,\u201d Chang went on to explain. \u000aSome students, such as Eliot Sands (PO \u201820), were dismayed that security costs are an obstacle to controversial speakers at the Claremont Colleges: \u201cThe speakers shouldn\u2019t have to charge the 5Cs [Claremont Colleges] in the first place, because violence has no place in political discourse,\u201d Sands said.\u000a\u201cPomona College shouldn\u2019t be responsible for its students breaking the law; local law enforcement should,\u201d he added.\u000aIt is not unheard of for colleges to pay for event security. Both UC Berkeley and University of Florida have chosen to fund speakers they thought likely to bring destructive crowds, though the financial cost to each was substantial.

aS'Student Op-Ed: Outdoor Clubs Are Too White'
p15
aVIn an opinion editorial for the Student Life, the administration-funded student newspaper at the Claremont Colleges, a white Pitzer student frets that the colleges\u2019 outdoor programs, though open to all students and well-funded, are \u201cpredominantly white spaces\u201d that deny people of color \u201caccess to the outdoors.\u201d\u000aThe article, written by Malcolm McCann, a freshman at Pitzer College\u2014one of the member institutions of the Claremont Colleges\u2014calls out clubs like Pitzer Outdoor Adventure (POA) and On the Loose (OTL), among the most amply funded outdoor clubs at the Claremont Colleges, for being \u201cpredominately white spaces.\u201d\u000a\u201cBoth clubs claim to be accessible: while trips are open to any student wanting to go, not everyone feels the same ease in entering the outdoors. This discomfort is unfortunately caused by existing racial boundaries,\u201d McCann proposed.\u000aThe article helpfully explains that white imperialism, as well as the fact that three prominent naturalist figures in U.S. history happen to be white, generate this pervasive racial exclusion:\u000a\u201cHistorically, white people in imperialist conquests have appropriated land as their own. North America rightfully belongs to indigenous communities, yet it has been taken away from them by force. Consequently, a false sense of ownership of nature permeates white America.\u201d\u000a\u201cSimilarly, the image of a modern outdoor enthusiasts is white, as is the historical image of a naturalist. The great icons of nature \u2013 John Muir, Walt Whitman, Henry David Thoreau \u2013 are all white men. At present, most famous rock climbers are also disproportionately white,\u201d McCann wrote. \u000aThe author takes the term \u201coutdoorsy\u201d as another expression of \u201cwhiteness\u201d that excludes people of color from outdoor activities.\u000a\u201cThis whiteness manifests in the term \u201coutdoorsy\u201d \u2013 a descriptor for those who spend a significant time in the outdoors, who are equipped with the necessary gear, and who feel connected to nature,\u201d he says. \u201cThe image of the \u201coutdoorsy individual\u201d is an exclusive classification that gives white people the authority to venture into the outdoors freely, leaving people of color behind.\u201d\u000aMcCann also points to financial barriers preventing students of color from spending time outdoors. \u201cMany National Parks are hundreds of miles from large cities. Consequently, only those with access to a vehicle and money for gas will be able to enjoy them\u201d he explains. \u201cSimilarly, only students with economic privilege have the resources to attend summer programs that teach wilderness skills.\u201d\u000aHe adds that the \u201cemphasis on acquiring requisite skills \u2026 excludes low-income individuals.\u201d\u000aThe Claremont Colleges\u2019 outdoor clubs, however, are extremely well-funded, as McCann concedes, and students\u2019 financial barriers usually are surmounted with the assistance of college funding. In addition to heavily subsidized transportation options for students making their own trips to the outdoors, Pomona College\u2019s outdoor club sponsors several free or nearly-free trips a year, as well as loaning gear to any 5C student at no charge.\u000aAt Claremont McKenna College, the Outdoor Initiative organizes and funds several outdoor camping trips during holidays like Thanksgiving and Fall Break. At Pitzer College, the \u201cPitzer Outdoor Adventure\u201d club of which McCann is a member began this school year with over $7,500 of funding.\u000aMcCann suggests several solutions to the inclusivity crisis he claims to identify in his article. Among these are affirming that \u201cnature exists as a collective space owned by all by virtue of being human, not by virtue of being white,\u201d having \u201cmore accessible, entry-level workshops and trips that do not require advanced technical skills,\u201d and encouraging white people not to exert domination of the word \u201coutdoorsy.\u201d\u000aMcCann\u2019s outcry against outdoor clubs and activities is not the first to come out of the Claremont Colleges\u2014last year a speedo hike organized by the On the Loose outdoors club of the Claremont Colleges was cancelled over concerns of \u201cbody image\u201d and \u201cbro-iness.\u201d\u000aInterestingly, McCann is a white student, sporting hiking gear in his Facebook profile photo. When asked for further information, McCann asked to remain off the record, and did not address whether he is part of the problem he identifies.

aS'Student Group Blasts College for Admitting Too Few Convicts'
p19
aVAn unnamed student group is attacking Pomona College for its \u201cadmission policy that allows for discrimination\u201d against former convicts, claiming that the \u201cfacts\u201d surrounding a person\u2019s incarceration \u201cdon\u2019t always tell the full story\u201d and \u201cmight not account for structures that either privilege or police certain individuals.\u201d\u000aIn a series of college-approved posters affixed earlier today across the campus of the elite liberal arts college, the group urges students to consider how \u201cthe voices of incarcerated leaders, scholars, artists, and engaged members\u201d are \u201cbarred, silenced, and suppressed by Pomona\u2019s admission policy.\u201d\u000aThe group also encourages students to question free speech protections, which are regarded as an affirmation of whiteness.\u000aReferencing a statement from former Pomona College president David Oxtoby, which defended free speech in the aftermath of the April 2017 protest of conservative, pro-police scholar Heather Mac Donald, the group asks: \u201cWhy does Pomona College legitimate the speech of those whose words continues [sic] to construct and uphold the white supremacy it claims to condemn, when Pomona has the ability to amplify the speech of incarcerated individuals whose voices are systematically silenced?\u201d\u000aQuoting James Cone, a black scholar, the students continue that \u201cwhat is wrong with America is \u2026 its belief that persons can affirm whiteness and humanity at the same time.\u201d\u000aA second poster cites an email from an unnamed campus administrator detailing the college\u2019s policy on admitting incarcerated students.\u000a\u201cOur policy is to take all the information in the application into account,\u201d the cited email states. \u201cAs with any piece of information in the application the entire Admissions Committee would evaluate the circumstances surrounding [an applicant\u2019s criminal] offense, as well as the applicant\u2019s response to the questions in the application, and we would make a judgment using all the facts presented, in addition to assessing the applicant\u2019s potential for success at Pomona.\u201d\u000aAccording to the student group, this email illustrates that the college can engage in unjust discrimination.\u000a\u201cInjustice often hides in plain sight, in \u2018common sense\u2019 statements about circumstances, and facts,\u201d the group writes, captioning the school\u2019s email. \u201cLanguage has a way of making injustice seem \u2018normal,\u2019 and thus acceptable, to those who are privileged enough to have it stay out of their way. The \u2018facts\u2019 don\u2019t always tell the full story. The \u2018circumstances\u2019 might not account for structures that either privilege or police certain individuals.\u201d\u000a\u201cPomona College claims that a criminal record \u2018does not disqualify\u2019 a person from admittance. At the same time, they write that they will \u2018make a judgment using all the facts presented.\u2019 What this really says: Pomona can discriminate against an admission applicant for having a criminal record,\u201d the caption concludes.\u000aAnother poster suggests that Pomona\u2019s policy on admitting former convicts demonstrates the college\u2019s lack of commitment to diversity, and asks: \u201cWhy does Pomona subject formerly incarcerated people to further extrajudicial discrimination?\u201d\u000aThe posters contain a link (PDF version here) to an online statement, in which the student group explains that its aim is to \u201craise significant awareness\u201d of the college\u2019s \u201cadmissions policy that allows for discrimination against individuals who have been incarcerated.\u201d\u000a\u201cWe aim to destabilize Pomona College\u2019s representation of itself by drawing attention to who is not addressed in statements put forth to produce and promote Pomona\u2019s image,\u201d the students write. \u201cWe have chosen the format of posters placed strategically across campus because we want to denaturalize the physical space of campus to provoke people who are a part of this institution to consider, if they have not already, what experiences and perspectives may not be as represented.\u201d\u000aThe students hope that \u201cthose who read the posters will be led to question the structural underpinnings of their own path to Pomona.\u201d\u000aCurrent and former Pomona students had mixed reactions to the campus postings.\u000a\u201cOur criminal justice system is inequitable, and no college should discriminate against applicants based on having a record alone,\u201d said Kate Dolgenos (PO \u201817), in a message to the Independent. \u201cHowever, given the severity of some criminal charges, the college should be able to factor in criminal records when they evaluate applicants.\u201d\u000aPomona senior Jerry Yan (\u201818) expressed similar sentiments.\u000a\u201cI agree with the group\u2019s premise that hearing from formerly incarcerated persons can be valuable and can go a long way in furthering Pomona\u2019s self-professed mission of creating a diverse campus environment that exposes students to a range of different perspectives,\u201d Yan told the Independent.\u000a\u201cThat said, the context matters a great deal; I imagine that many would be uncomfortable attending college with someone who has an extensive history of sexual assault, for example. But if the admissions office believes that a deserving applicant who has a prior criminal record has taken the appropriate steps to move on or that the nature of the applicant\u2019s prior conduct does not merit serious concern, then by all means the applicant should be admitted. I would look forward to meeting such a person, and hearing what they have to share,\u201d he continued.\u000aPomona College\u2019s Office of Admissions has yet to respond to the Independent\u2019s request for comment.

aS'Scripps Funds Propaganda Whitewashing Human Rights Violations'
p23
aVScripps College is hosting and funding a three-day speakers\u2019 series with a Venezuelan government official to valorize that country\u2019s totalitarian regime and spread awareness of the \u201ctruth in today\u2019s Venezuela,\u201d whitewashing the ruling regime\u2019s extensive human rights abuses, the Independent has learned.\u000aThe series, which ends on Wednesday, features Antonio Cordero, who serves as a Consul General of Nicholas Maduro\u2019s authoritarian government and has been a business director for \u201cvarious People\u2019s Power enterprises,\u201d according to an event advertisement.\u000aOne event in the series will focus on Maduro\u2019s new assembly\u2014the product of a rigged election that prompted the U.S. to institute economic sanctions against the Maduro regime\u2014and explain how it expresses the \u201cPEOPLE\u2019S POWER in Venezuela, the Highest Power in the Land.\u201d\u000aOther events will whitewash the dictator\u2019s imprisonment of political opponents and blame the slaughter of political protesters by Maduro\u2019s government on his \u201crightwing\u201d opposition.\u000aThree Scripps programs and departments\u2014Core, History, and Latin American & Caribbean Studies\u2014are listed as sponsors of the series. In an email to the Independent, Andrew Aisenberg, the chair of the college\u2019s history department, confirmed that \u201cthe history department did provide financial support for the Venezuela events.\u201d Additionally, at least some Scripps students are required to attend this speakers\u2019 series or an unrelated talk later in the week.\u000aPeople line up for blocks for a chance to enter a local supermarket in Venezuela. (Photo: Flickr)\u000aA flyer for the first event recites several Maduro government talking points, dismissing, without providing evidence, documentation by human rights organizations and international media of massive irregularities in both the Maduro-backed July vote for a constitutional assembly and the regional elections held in the middle of this month:\u000a\u201cVenezuela, with an electoral system that experts believe to be the most transparent in the world, registers an overwhelming win for socialists in gubernatorial elections of October 15. Record voter turn-out is higher than presidential election turn-out in many western countries.

aS'CMC Decides Against Quashing Christian Student Group'
p27
aVThis evening, the President of the Associated Students of Claremont McKenna College (ASCMC)\u2014the college\u2019s student government\u2014released an email to the student body of Claremont McKenna College announcing that the Claremont College\u2019s local chapter of InterVarsity\u20145CIV\u2014was no longer under review. Previously, ASCMC had defunded 5CIV and planned to vote on the potential dissolution of the Christian fellowship organization in their next Executive Board meeting on October 22nd. In addition to being free from the threat of dissolution, 5CIV has been encouraged to apply for funding in the spring semester. \u000aIn his email, the President of ASCMC stated that the Student Senate had been concerned that InterVarsity, as a national organization, excluded LGBTQIA+ members from leadership roles. However, he went on to clarify that this turned out to be a reiteration of InterVarsity\u2019s theological position on human sexuality. The statement in question\u2014which InterVarsity released last year\u2014acknowledged \u201cthat LGBTQI people have experienced great pain, including much caused by Christians\u201d and stated that InterVarsity \u201ccontinue[s] to employ individuals who have an LGBTQI identity and who affirm our theological beliefs around human sexuality.\u201d\u000aThe President of ASCMC went on to write: \u201cThe initial concern was that if such a statement did come from InterVarsity Christian Fellowship, students of the LGBTQIA+ community who espouse the Christian faith would be excluded from joining or performing leadership roles in the Claremont 5CIV organization.\u201d\u000aHe explained that, upon reviewing the situation with Nyree Gray, Assistant Vice President for Diversity and Inclusion, and Devon MacIver, Assistant Dean of Students for Student Activities and Orientation, ASCMC found \u201cno cases reported in which students at CMC have been unwelcome by 5CIV.\u201d Therefore, the 5CIV was found not to be in violation of the school\u2019s non-discrimination clause.\u201d\u000aKate Vosburg, 5CIV\u2019s Staff Minister, told the Independent that 5CIV leaders contacted Ms. Gray earlier this week regarding ASCMC\u2019s upcoming vote. Ms. Gray had been previously unaware of the situation, including ASCMC\u2019s denial of funding to 5CIV. \u000aAccording to Vosburg, after Ms. Gray had reviewed the situation in full, she \u201crespectfully and clearly\u201d explained to ASCMC that it did not have the authority to derecognize 5CIV, as it was a 5C club. Moreover, Ms. Gray stated that no student organization could be dissolved for its religious beliefs so long as it affirmed the non-discrimination clause and abided by other campus rules\u2026ASCMC senators were receptive to what she said and ready to change their actions accordingly.\u201d   \u000a\u201cI\u2019m grateful that the basic American liberties of freedom of religion and freedom of assembly have been preserved at the Claremont Colleges.\u201d Vosburg stated, \u201cThis is not just good for 5CIV. This is good for all other religious groups and for groups who represent a minority group or opinion.  The administration has preserved space for diversity of beliefs at Claremont which is essential for Claremont to be a place of higher learning.\u201d\u000aClaremont McKenna College (CMC) is part of the Claremont Colleges Consortium, which includes four other undergraduate institutions: Pomona College, Scripps College, Harvey Mudd College, and Pitzer College.\u000aThe body of the ASCMC President\u2019s email can be found below:

aS'Student Government May Dissolve Christian Student Group'
p31
aVIn a meeting last Monday, Claremont McKenna College\u2019s student senate\u2014the Associated Students of Claremont McKenna College (ASCMC)\u2014met with representatives from 5C InterVarsity (5CIV), the Claremont College\u2019s local chapter of a national evangelical Christian fellowship organization\u2014InterVarsity (IVCF)\u2014and proposed dissolving 5CIV\u2019s club charter.\u000a5CIV is a student run-Christian fellowship organization that organizes and hosts small-group Bible studies during the week for students of the Claremont Colleges, of which CMC is a member institution. Their stated purpose is \u201cto establish and advance at the 5Cs [Claremont Colleges] a witnessing community of students and faculty who follow Jesus as Lord and Savior: growing in love for God, God\u2019s word, God\u2019s people of every ethnicity and culture and God\u2019s purposes in the world.\u201d\u000aOne of 5CIV\u2019s leaders told the Independent that 5CIV was only notified of the meeting and the topic for discussion minutes before it commenced. At the meeting, which three 5CIV leaders attended, one student senator referred to the Christian students in 5CIV as \u201ccowards,\u201d while in a private conversation outside of the meeting, another student senator compared 5CIV to the Ku Klux Klan.\u000aThe sharp invective reflected the swirl of rumor and myth that has surrounded 5CIV\u2019s membership policies over the past few years. IVCF\u20145CIV\u2019s national parent organization\u2014requires that paid leaders of its local chapters agree with its conception of Christian theology, which includes a traditional stance on sex outside of a monogamous, heterosexual marriage.\u000a\u201cInterVarsity believes Christlikeness includes both embracing Scripture\u2019s teachings on human sexuality as well as defending the dignity of all people, including LGBTQI individuals, because they are made in God\u2019s image,\u201d IVCF\u2019s website explained.\u000aThough this rule only governs organization leadership, and is neither a membership qualification\u2014non-leading members may hold whatever views they wish\u2014nor exclusionary of any identities, some student senators have taken this rule to mean that gays and lesbians are excluded from group membership.\u000aKate Vosburg, 5CIV\u2019s Staff Minister, told the Independent that the student members of 5CIV spent much of the meeting with student senators dispelling false allegations about the organization, its views on LGBTQ people, and the actual national policy to which the organization adheres.\u000a\u201cOne rumor is that 5CIV leaders are required to sign a pledge that they\u2019re not LGBTQ. That never has been the case, nor will it ever be,\u201d she said. \u201cAnother rumor was that 5CIV does not allow LGBTQ students into membership or leadership, or that 5CIV does not allow theologically-affirming students as members or leaders. Again, that is not true and will not be true.\u201d \u000a\u201cAll students are welcome to 5CIV and leadership qualifications do not include questions of sexuality,\u201d Vosburg continued. \u000aAnother popular myth that 5CIV had to deflect was the rumor \u201cthat IVCF nationally does not hire LGBTQ people.\u201d\u000aAccording to Vosburg, \u201c[t]his again is blatantly false. IVCF has, does, and will continue to hire LGBTQ Christians to serve as IV staff. The policy in question is about theological qualifications for being hired; it is NOT about one\u2019s orientation or identity.\u201d\u000aOn Sunday, according to 5CIV members, the student senate will have another open hearing on this matter.\u000aIt is unclear that ASCMC has the power to dissolve 5CIV\u2019s charter or what that dissolution would mean for the organization. ASCMC already decided to withhold money from 5CIV for the 2017-2018 school year, after funding InterVarsity for many years, due to the unfounded rumors surrounding InterVarsity\u2019s hiring policies.\u000aVosburg speculates that future action \u201cwould mean that we could not host 5CIV events at CMC. It would certainly mean that we would get no funding.\u201d \u000aAccording to the Claremont Colleges handbook for student organizations, an organization may be suspended or lose recognition if it violates the nondiscrimination clause, fails a financial audit, and/or fails basic registration requirements.\u000a5CIV must also adhere to the \u201cInterfaith Chaplaincy of the Claremont Colleges Guidelines for Student Organizations.\u201d The handbook does not state that having a charter dissolved by a student senate of any of the Claremont Colleges could lead to suspension or loss of recognition for the club. \u000aA move to dissolve 5CIV\u2019s charter at CMC would have some precedent. Last fall, ASHMC\u2014the student senate of Harvey Mudd College, another member institution of the Claremont Colleges\u2014gave 5CIV provisional recognition while it considered whether 5CIV should have exemption from the nondiscrimination clause as a religious organization on the basis that IVCF\u2019s hiring policies requires group leaders to agree with a certain conception of the Christian faith.

aS'\xe2\x80\x9cAnti-Muslim\xe2\x80\x9d Dissenters Disrupt Scripps Open Lecture '
p39
aVOn Tuesday afternoon, during an open lecture at Scripps College, several attendees unaffiliated with the college challenged the lecturer to explain his views about Islamist terrorism and President Trump\u2019s immigration policies, sparking half an hour of testy debate that culminated in an email from a Scripps dean providing resources to students traumatized by the exchange.\u000aThe lecture, part of Scripps\u2019s Tuesday Noon Academy speaker series held in conjunction with the Scripps Humanities Institute, was on the subject of American-Islamic Relations and xenophobic rhetoric in the wake of the 2016 presidential election.\u000aA video taken by an audience member shows one of the dissenters asking the speaker\u2014Hussam Ayloush, Executive Director of the Los Angeles chapter of the Council of American-Islamic Relations (CAIR-LA)\u2014if CAIR disavows suicide bombings.\u000aThe exchange devolved into a shouting match between the dissenter and Professor Hao Huang, the director of the Scripps Humanities Institute, who told the man, \u201cyou don\u2019t belong here if you can\u2019t shut up. Shut up!\u201d\u000aComposed throughout the exchange, Ayloush responded that \u201cas a Muslim, I cannot enter paradise if I didn\u2019t believe in the sanctity of life,\u201d but refrained from offering a yes or no answer to the question.\u000aIn a later exchange a different dissenter berated a Scripps student for being brainwashed.\u000aThroughout the question and answer period like-minded attendees variously volunteered their concerns about community safety\u2014\u201cI have Jewish friends who didn\u2019t want to come here today because they were afraid for their safety\u201d\u2014and their dissatisfaction with Ayloush characterizing President Trump\u2019s travel ban as a \u201cMuslim ban.\u201d\u000a\u201c[Trump\u2019s travel ban] was not a Muslim ban; it was a travel ban!\u201d one attendee said to the speaker. \u201cYou\u2019re a bigot and a liar.\u201d\u000aAt the conclusion of the question-and-answer session, one of the dissenters accused Ayloush of deception: \u201cYou can\u2019t have a dialogue when lying at every step of the argument.\u201d\u000aSeveral student attendees walked out during the hostilities. \u000aAccording to the event description, the purpose of the lecture was to discuss how \u201c[t]he xenophobic rhetoric of the 2016 presidential election has only intensified since Donald Trump took office, and campaign promises have manifested into tangible policies and executive orders that have stalled immigration applications, torn families apart, grounded travelers, and instilled fear in entire immigrant communities throughout the nation.\u201d\u000aThe description also condemned President Trump\u2019s language and policies pertaining to the \u201cMuslim Ban,\u201d and contended that Ayloush would \u201ctrace the evolution of Islamophobic policies from the fringe to the mainstream, showing how presidential decrees like the Muslim Ban actually have precedents that are decades old.\u201d\u000aHussam Ayloush is no stranger to controversy. Last December he issued an apology for an ill-conceived tweet about a Russian military jet that crashed on its way to war torn Syria: \u201cI\u2019m sad about the crashed Russian military jet. The Tu-154 could have carried up to 180 military personnel instead of just 92!\u201d he had written.\u000aShortly after the incident at the lecture, Scripps Vice President for Student Affairs and Dean of Students Charlotte Johnson issued an email statement noting the availability of resources for students impacted by the \u201canti-Muslim and anti-immigrant\u201d comments, \u201cwhich are in direct conflict with our shared values.\u201d\u000aDean Johnson added that members of the Scripps community who felt targeted by race, religion, ancestry, age, among other identities, \u201cmay contact our Title IX office and make a complaint under Scripps College\u2019s harassment and discrimination policy.\u201d\u000aScripps College\u2019s student government\u2014Scripps Associated Students (SAS)\u2014also issued a statement, condemning \u201cthese sentiments of islamophobia and hatred. We offer warm thoughts and support to those who were affected by these events.\u201d\u000aScripps College\u2014along with Pitzer College, Claremont McKenna College, Pomona College, and Harvey Mudd College\u2014is a member of the Claremont University Consortium.\u000aThe body of Dean Johnson\u2019s email is included below:

aS'Student Senate Seeks to Erase Columbus Day'
p43
aVOn Saturday, Pomona College\u2019s student government\u2014the Associated Students of Pomona College (ASPC)\u2014and its president Maria Vides introduced a resolution into the ASPC Senate seeking to \u201cInstitutionally Recognize Indigenous People\u2019s Day\u201d in lieu of Columbus Day, a federal holiday.\u000aThe resolution states that \u201cstudents, faculty, and staff at the intersections have had and will presumably continue to have cause to demonstrate in order to ensure Indigenous tribes globally are recognized, especially those impacted by the consequences of Columbus\u2019 arrival to the Americas and the history of colonization that followed. We express solidarity with and encourage participation in institutional, local, national, and international movements for justice regarding Indigenous People\u2019s history and rights.\u201d\u000aThe resolution seeks to follow in the footsteps of several other colleges including Pitzer College, Stanford University, Yale University, Brown University, Cornell University, Hamilton College, and Occidental College.  \u000a\u201cFive U.S. States formally do not celebrate Columbus Day, and 39 U.S. cities have passed legislation to celebrate Indigenous People\u2019s Day in lieu of Columbus Day,\u201d the resolution asserts, before asking the college to institutionally recognize Indigenous People\u2019s Day. \u000aThe resolution would also remove all mentions of Columbus Day from \u201cthe academic calendar distributed to students at the start of the academic year, and all other official documents.\u201d\u000aIn a message to the Independent, a student of Native American descent stated that \u201cPomona College doesn\u2019t honor our veterans during the year, and with this move, the student senate has shown that it doesn\u2019t value dialogue about our nation\u2019s history either.\u201d\u000a\u201cDrafting students into a forced veneration of my indigenous culture is wrong and inappropriately shifts the focus away from a critical debate about Columbus as a man and a defining figure in our history. Paying lip service to my culture and ignoring Columbus is par for the course for a student senate that would rather pretend Columbus didn\u2019t exist than to assess his humanity in any remotely complex way,\u201d he added. \u000aOther students from the Claremont Colleges\u2014a university consortium of which Pomona College is a part\u2014differed, with one sophomore from Scripps College telling the Independent that she \u201cthink[s] that [Indigenous People\u2019s Day] [is] a smart idea; considering that most of the administration on most campuses have already expressed dissent about Columbus Day\u2026 I think that it\u2019s the natural action for the other 5C\u2019s [Claremont Colleges] to follow Pomona\u2019s lead.\u201d\u000a\u201c[I]t is necessary to officially replace it so that students don\u2019t just let the day pass without thinking of the importance of [Columbus] on indigenous people,\u201d she said.\u000aColumbus Day is recognized by the state of California. A bill to replace Columbus Day with \u201cNative American Day\u201d was proposed but did not pass in 2013.  \u000aPomona College is part of the Claremont Colleges Consortium, which also includes Claremont McKenna College, Scripps College, Harvey Mudd and Pitzer College. Only Pitzer College has adopted Indigenous People\u2019s Day.\u000aASPC President Maria Vides did not offer a comment to the Independent at the time of publication.  \u000aNote: The resolution linked in the article is a live document that is constantly being updated with comments. For the initial document on which this article was based, please refer to this file.\u000aWilliam Gu contributed reporting.

aS'MEMEGATE: Pomona\xe2\x80\x99s Disciplinary Options Limited by California Law'
p51
aVAfter discovering a student-run meme page that contained \u201cdeplorable\u201d and \u201cdeeply offensive\u201d pictures and text, Pomona College launched a \u201cBias-Incident Response Team,\u201d which quickly concluded that the meme page constitutes a \u201cbias-related incident.\u201d\u000aThe college, however, has very limited legal grounds for action against the students in the group\u2014even those who posted the most offensive content\u2014due to a certain California law that extends federal First Amendment protections to all students at higher education institutions, public and private alike.\u000aPomona College deems an incident \u201cbias-related\u201d when it expresses \u201chostility against another individual (or group) because of the other person\u2019s (or group\u2019s) race, color, religion [etc.] \u2026 or because the perpetrator perceives that the other person (or group) has one or more of these characteristics.\u201d\u000aIn his email discussing the college\u2019s decision, Dean Ric Townes did remind the recipients of his email that \u201c[d]epending on the circumstances, a bias-related incident may not be a crime and may be protected speech.\u201d\u000aHe also revealed, however, that the incident is still under review \u201cwith regard to the Student Code or other policy violation,\u201d implying that the college may have some kind of authority over the content of a private meme page to which many of its students belonged.\u000aThis implication opens a number of critical questions: What is protected speech in a California private college? How much jurisdiction does a California private college have concerning speech policy violations? And, what sort of punishments can the college administer in response to \u201cbias-related incidents\u201d?\u000aIn 1992, the Leonard Law\u2014named for its author, State Senator Bill Leonard\u2014was passed by the California State Legislature. This law extends the First Amendment and the California Constitution\u2019s protections of freedom of speech to students at private colleges in California.\u000a\u201cNo private postsecondary educational institution shall make or enforce a rule subjecting a student to disciplinary sanctions solely on the basis of conduct that is speech or other communication that, when engaged in outside the campus or facility of a private postsecondary institution, is protected from governmental restriction by the First Amendment to the United States Constitution or Section 2 of Article I of the California Constitution.\u201d\u000aIn light of this law, Pomona College would need to show either that the content on the meme page is unprotected by the First Amendment or the California Constitution, or, alternatively, that the content constitutes \u201chate violence.\u201d\u000aThree classes of unprotected speech are relevant to the case at hand. The first is speech classed as \u201cincitement\u201d\u2014speech that is both \u201cdirected at inciting or producing imminent lawless action\u201d and \u201clikely to incite or produce such action,\u201d as established in Brandenburg v. Ohio.\u000aThe second is the category of \u201cfighting words,\u201d which are words that \u201ctend to incite an immediate breach of the peace,\u201d as determined in Chaplinsky v. New Hampshire.\u000aLast is the category of words with \u201cthe intent to intimidate,\u201d which were ruled unprotected under the First Amendment in Virginia v. Black.\u000aOne of the exceptions of Leonard Law is that it \u201cdoes not prohibit an institution from adopting rules and regulations that are designed to prevent hate violence, as defined in subdivision (a) of Section 4 of Chapter 1363 of the Statutes of 1992.\u201d\u000aThe Statutes of 1992 define \u201chate violence\u201d as follows: \u201cany act of physical intimidation or physical harassment, physical force or physical violence that is directed against any person or group of persons, or the property of any person or group of persons because of the ethnicity, race, national, origin, religion, sex, sexual orientation, disability, or political or religious beliefs of that person or group.\u201d\u000a\u201cActs shall not be considered \u2018hate violence\u2019\u2026 based on speech alone,\u201d the statute clarifies, \u201cexcept upon a showing that the speech itself threatens violence against a specific person or group of persons, that the person or group of persons against whom the threat is directed reasonably fears that the violence will be committed because of the speech, and that the person threatening violence had the apparent ability to carry out that threat.\u201d\u000aUnder Pomona\u2019s speech policy, an act of speech either must constitute a threat of violence or must meet all three of the following standards in order to be proscribed:\u000a\u201c(1) the speech, considered objectively, is abusive and insulting rather than a communication of ideas,\u000a(2) the speech is directed at an individual and actually used in an abusive manner in a situation that presents an actual danger that it will cause an immediate breach of the peace by inciting a violent reaction by the individual to whom the speech is addressed and,\u000a(3) the student intends the speech to be abusive and insulting rather than a communication of ideas.\u201d (emphasis added)\u000aFrom what I have seen of the most egregious contents of said Facebook group (view here), the meme group has violated none of the above speech codes. The images and jokes on the page cannot in any way be reasonably interpreted as incitement to lawlessness or to a breach of the peace, as intimidation, as harassment, or as a threat of violence.\u000aSo, why does the Pomona College administration not come out and state the obvious? Is it because they are not aware of the Leonard Law? Not aware of what constitutes unprotected speech? Do they intend to challenge the Leonard Law in the Supreme Court? Or rather, do they have other, more political, reasons for failing to level with their student body about the college\u2019s actual authority over student speech?\u000aIf the answer is ignorance, then Pomona\u2019s administration is not the only party that fails to grasp the legal protections to which California college students are entitled. The coverage of \u2018Memegate\u2019 has also failed to discuss the implications of the Leonard Law and has emphasized the possibility of disciplinary action despite the college\u2019s limited powers.\u000aIn an article published by Inside Higher Ed this week in response to the meme page and Pomona\u2019s investigation, Kevin Kruger\u2014the President of NASPA, \u201cthe leading association for the advancement, health, and sustainability of the student affairs profession\u201d\u2014said that \u201cI think it would be hard, but not impossible, to take action simply on the basis of a student participating in the group, or even posting an offensive meme, if that meme was not in and of itself threatening or harassing to an individual.\u201d (emphasis added)\u000aTeen Vogue\u2019s article about the meme group claimed that \u201cif the university [sic] decides that the meme group does fall within their bias incident rules, the students may be fully penalized.\u201d \u000aSimilarly, Ross Steinberg claimed in his exposé of the group that \u201cThe Pomona College Code lists as violations acts of speech where \u2018the student intends the speech to be abusive and insulting rather than a communication of ideas\u2019 as well as when, \u2018the speech, considered objectively, is abusive and insulting rather than a communication of ideas.\u2019\u201d\u000aBut, importantly, such communications are not violations unless they also constitute an \u201cactual danger\u201d to its addressee. Steinberg entirely omitted this critical point from his discussion of the policy.\u000aAll of these characterizations of the college\u2019s legal powers and of the purpose of the incident response team are inaccurate. The college\u2019s own policy fully acknowledges that, even if speech is determined to be a \u201cbias incident,\u201d the speech in question may still be protected by law and therefore cannot legally be subject to any sanction whatsoever.\u000aIf these people are simply misinformed or uninformed, then the best I can do is to point out where they have erred. Pomona College, however, has a responsibility to its students to be entirely transparent about the extent of their ability, as a California college, to punish students for their speech. They have an obligation to inform their students of their rights\u2014whether the college agrees with their speech or not.\u000aI can only conclude that, in omitting this critical information, Pomona\u2019s administrators intend one of two things: either they desire that students perceive them to have authority where they in fact have none, or they are attempting to satisfy a certain political narrative popular among their student body, a narrative in which to defend freedom of speech is to endorse the \u201chateful\u201d or \u201coffensive\u201d speech that this fundamental right protects.\u000aIn the wake of the college\u2019s decision not to punish Pomona students who created an illicit blockade at Claremont McKenna College last semester, my hope is that our new president, Gabi Starr, reaffirms David Oxtoby\u2019s commitment to \u201cthe exercise of free speech,\u201d which our former president made in an email sent out concerning the Athenaeum affair last semester. To be silent is a disservice to her students, who are legally entitled to free speech, but who may not be aware of their rights and fear repercussions for exercising them.

aS'Student Wants to Tear Down German Composer Frieze'
p59
aVLast week, in an opinion article for The Student Life (TSL)\u2014the student-government funded newspaper of the Claremont Colleges\u2014a Pomona College student called for the removal of German composer Richard Wagner\u2019s frieze from Pomona\u2019s Bridges Auditorium, explicitly echoing recent calls to tear down Confederate statues.\u000a\u201cIn spite of renewed determination to combat anti-Semitism from members of both major political parties and organizations across the spectrum, the spotlight has yet to expose a principle anti-Semite memorialized on our very own campus: Richard Wagner, one of five composers whose name and likeness is etched onto Pomona College\u2019s Bridges Auditorium,\u201d the article states. \u000aThe article argues that \u201che [Wagner] diffused his prejudice not only through his inclusion of anti-Semitic tropes and characters in his operas, but also through articles such as \u2018Das Judenthum in der Musik\u2019 or \u2018Jewishness in Music.\u2019\u201d\u000aQuestioning the decision of putting Wagner\u2019s frieze up in the first place, the article asserts that \u201cit [Wagner\u2019s frieze] is a relic of the era in which the building was constructed: a time when there were quotas on Jewish enrollment in higher education, or when Jews were barred from attending universities altogether.\u201d\u000a\u201cHigher education\u2019s past injustices toward Jews makes it all the more crucial that we clearly acknowledge that Richard Wagner is the Robert E. Lee of our campus,\u201d asserts the student.\u000aTying the fate of the frieze to the recent movement to tear down Confederate statues across the country, the article states that \u201c[t]he glorification of Lee and Wagner is unacceptable and their hateful ideologies deserve to be expunged from existence. As Robert E. Lee must be torn down from his podium in Charlottesville, so too must Wagner be removed from his lofty perch on Pomona\u2019s most prized structure\u2026\u201d\u000aWhile the article\u2019s author does admit Wagner\u2019s musical brilliance, he believes that brilliance does not grant Wagner \u201cunadulterated\u201d commemoration:\u000a\u201c[Wagner] was, unquestionably, a very gifted composer\u2026.marveling at Wagner\u2019s musical talent does not forgive his vile attitude toward Jews. Nor does it grant him the right to unadulterated celebration, either in concert or as ornamentation.\u201d\u000aFor further insight into this matter, the Independent contacted Professor Eric Lindholm, conductor of the Pomona College Orchestra and professor of music, for comment on the controversy surrounding Wagner and musicians\u2019\u2014including the Pomona College Orchestra\u2019s\u2014stances on performing Wagner.\u000aAccording to Professor Lindholm, \u201c[t]he decision of whether to perform Wagner is a tricky one. It is not just that he was virulently anti-Semitic, but that so much of his entire artistic philosophy was based on an intense German nationalism that included anti-Semitism as a key ingredient.\u201d\u000a\u201cIt is not possible to separate Wagner\u2019s music from his broader cultural views. Some musicians refuse to perform Wagner, but we also have someone like James Levine, who is Jewish and one of the greatest Wagner conductors of all time. Each artist needs to come to terms on their own with how they handle Wagner.\u201d\u000a\u201cIn the classroom, Wagner cannot be ignored.  Most scholars would agree that he and Beethoven are the two most important composers of the nineteenth century,\u201d adding that \u201c[Wagner\u2019s] influences\u2026are seen in the work of countless other artists. But studying Wagner does not mean endorsing his views, any more than studying racism or sexism as cultural phenomena means endorsing those perspectives.\u201d\u000aAs for the Pomona College Orchestra\u2019s performances of Wagner, Professor Lindholm stated that \u201c[the orchestra] performed Wagner on only two programs during my 22-plus years here.  Both times, I alerted the members of the orchestra to the problems with Wagner and invited them to opt out if they would find the experience too objectionable, but no one has.\u201d The Pomona College Orchestra has not played a piece by Wagner since the 2013-2014 academic year.\u000aOn the frieze itself, Lindholm noted that \u201cit could stand to be updated. The five composers featured were all dead before the College was even founded. Given the range of performances that take place in Big Bridges, not to mention elsewhere on campus, there is no reason to present it as being primarily for Western art music.\u201d\u000aThe opinion article concludes by advising the country to be \u201cvigilant\u201d of anti-semitism across the world.\u000a\u201cIt is now, in a time of increased anti-Semitic incidents, not just in the United States, but also worldwide, particularly on college campuses, that we must remain vigilant of everyday occurrences of prevailing anti-Semitism. Although students on campus may not be aware of the painful history Wagner evokes, I shudder to perform in Bridges Auditorium\u2026\u201d\u000aIn a statement to the Independent, a Pomona College spokesperson said the college is \u201cnot aware of any previous requests\u201d to tear down Wagner\u2019s frieze and that they \u201cdo not have an estimate\u201d of how much removing the frieze might cost.\u000aBridges Auditorium was designed by architect William Templeton Johnson and built in 1931. The architect drew inspiration for the auditorium from \u201cNorthern Italian Renaissance architecture.\u201d It is considered to be one of the finest halls as well as one of the most photographed buildings in all of Southern California.\u000aPomona College is an elite liberal arts school in Southern California and founding member of the Claremont Consortium, which includes five undergraduate colleges and two graduate institutions.\u000aShare this:Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)MoreClick to print (Opens in new window)Click to share on Pinterest (Opens in new window)Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)Click to share on Google+ (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Tags: monuments Robert E.

aS'Pomona Refuses to Punish Students for Illicit Blockade of Conservative Speaker'
p67
aVIn an email sent this evening, Pomona College administrators characterized policy violations by Pomona students who blockaded the appearance of conservative speaker Heather Mac Donald at neighboring Claremont McKenna College (CMC) as \u201cminor\u201d and said that they would issue no sanctions for the students\u2019 conduct, claiming falsely that \u201cthere was no evidence that participants were instructed to disperse\u201d by campus authorities.\u000aDeclaring that the college had conducted \u201ca comprehensive review of photos and videos sent by CMC,\u201d the email, signed by Pomona deans Ric Townes and Christopher Waugh, acknowledged that \u201cPomona students were present and did block access to buildings\u201d in violation of college policy, but stopped short of issuing any sanctions for their conduct.\u000aThe deans justified the college\u2019s inaction with a number of claims, including that \u201cthere was no evidence that participants were instructed to disperse\u201d and that \u201cthere was no indication of property damage or physical altercations.\u201d\u000aIn such situations, the deans said, \u201cPomona College\u2019s approach has been to engage in conversations with students, reminding them of the policy,\u201d rather than giving the policy any force.\u000aThe deans neglected to address CMC\u2019s findings that the blockading students \u201cbreached institutional values of freedom of expression and assembly\u201d and \u201cviolated policies \u2026 that prohibit material disruption of college programs and created unsafe conditions in disregard of state law.\u201d\u000aAdditionally, at least one of the deans\u2019 claims\u2014that there was \u201cno evidence\u201d that campus authorities instructed student protesters to disperse\u2014is directly contradicted by the findings of Claremont McKenna\u2019s investigation and independent eyewitness accounts.\u000aIn a July statement discussing the protests, CMC announced that its investigation had revealed that \u201cthree Campus Safety Officers moved toward the [blockading] Group to advise them to stop [dismantling security fencing].\u201d\u000aAccording to the same statement, later on, as campus security \u201cretreated \u2026 to establish a secondary security boundary,\u201d students \u201cpaused their movement in acknowledgement of that boundary for almost two minutes\u201d before pressing through the officers to establish their illicit blockade.\u000aPomona\u2019s statement also asserts that \u201cthere was no indication of property damage or physical altercations.\u201d A video of the protests taken by an Independent staffer, however, shows the staffer being accosted, and other students and journalists were subjected to threats and physical intimidation from the mob of protesters.\u000aAsked by the Independent whether he would clarify the basis for the Pomona administrators\u2019 apparently false claim, a Pomona College spokesperson has yet to respond.\u000aThe Pomona deans\u2019 email is the first public acknowledgement by campus officials of an investigation into the conduct of Pomona students at the April protest at CMC, which, along with Pomona and three other undergraduate colleges, is part of the Claremont Colleges consortium and occupies the same Claremont, California campus.\u000aThe April protest, which ended with Claremont police officers rushing the speaker into an unmarked police vehicle to escape the student mob, ignited a firestorm of controversy across the country as well as on campus.\u000aUnder heavy pressure to defend CMC\u2019s commitment to freedom of speech on campus\u2014a commitment already bruised after he capitulated to student protesters and facilitated the highly visible resignation of a college dean in November 2015\u2014CMC President Hiram Chodosh responded quickly to the April protest, launching an investigation that resulted in multi-semester suspensions for a number of students by summer\u2019s end.\u000aThis swift justice was unique among the Claremont Colleges. Despite being the source of most of the protesters at Mac Donald\u2019s talk, none of the other colleges has issued sanctions to its students for blockading her speech and compromising the physical safety of those trapped inside the venue.\u000aIn a statement to the Independent in June, Pitzer College, another member of the Claremont Colleges consortium, said that it was not even in correspondence with CMC regarding any student code violations. At this point, Claremont McKenna had already completed its investigation and had scheduled disciplinary hearings.\u000aAsked about the deans\u2019 email, several Pomona students expressed strong disagreement with the college\u2019s decision to impose no sanctions on its policy violators.\u000aOne of these students, Matthew Ludlam, a sophomore at Pomona, told the Independent in a message that \u201cwhen Pomona doesn\u2019t punish the protesters they tell Claremont McKenna that they [Pomona] endorse their students actively disrupting [CMC\u2019s] campus activities.\u201d\u000aLudlam added that \u201cPomona students need to be punished if our school is to be taken seriously. What we [the students] did was wrong, and we should be held accountable for our actions.\u201d\u000a\u201cThe administration is being lazy and cowardly,\u201d said another Pomona student, who wished to remain anonymous. \u201cThis is going to affect relations between schools and how each holds both their own and other students accountable on its campus.\u201d\u000a\u201cThis is no doubt preemptive damage control,\u201d he continued, \u201cfor if Pomona\u2019s administration were to hold the college\u2019s students accountable, they would no doubt face backlash on their own campus that they don\u2019t want to be responsible for.\u201d\u000aBesides Pomona College and Claremont McKenna College, the Claremont Colleges consortium also includes Scripps College, Pitzer College, and Harvey Mudd College.

aS'Pitzer Dean of Students Concealed Material Evidence in Title IX Investigation'
p71
aVIn her former job as a director of judicial affairs at the University of California, Santa Barbara, Pitzer College\u2019s newly hired dean of students Sandra Vasquez concealed material evidence from a low-income, minority student seeking to defend himself against a suspension levied by school officials in response to unfounded criminal allegations, according to a March 2017 court order and complaint submitted in July.\u000aAccording to the complaint, to which the Independent has obtained access, during a September 2016 hearing with the student, Vasquez concealed two pieces of material evidence that she and the college were considering in the course of their investigation, despite assuring the student that she had disclosed to him all of the information upon which she and the college would rely in determining whether to lift his suspension.\u000aIn relying upon this unmentioned evidence\u2014which, upon revelation, proved to be uncorroborated and allegedly completely fabricated\u2014to sustain the student\u2019s suspension, Vasquez and other college officials willfully denied the student the opportunity to respond to all the evidence against him.\u000aIn fact, the student would not learn about all of this purported evidence until March 2017\u2014months after Vasquez and the college had decided to maintain his suspension indefinitely.\u000aIn that March 2017 court order, Superior Court Judge Thomas Anderle enjoined the enforcement of UCSB\u2019s suspension order and commanded the college to give the student \u201cfull access to UCSB and all programs and activities \u2026 with no restrictions.\u201d He castigated Vasquez and other college officials for violating the student\u2019s due process rights and thereby dispensing with one of the most critical elements of any judicial proceeding.\u000a\u201cJohn Doe [the student] is entitled to know all the information against him at the hearing; not via emailing his counsel allegedly critical and decisive information at a later time,\u201d Anderle declared. \u201cThe fact is, that it is patently obvious to this Court, Petitioner was seriously prejudiced by the use of [this evidence].\u201d\u000a\u201cThe backbone of our legal system requires all evidence to be presented in the Courtroom where it can be tested; it can be questioned,\u201d he continued. \u201cEvidence acquired otherwise is an abrogation of our legal system.\u201d\u000aAnderle also blasted Vasquez and other officials for stretching the college\u2019s investigation into the student\u2019s already vindicated conduct over nearly three quarters of school\u2014more than 200 days, in blatant violation of the college\u2019s own statutory obligations\u2014in an effort to discourage him from attending at all.\u000a\u201cThis Court concludes that the University is intentionally doing indirectly what it is unwilling to do directly,\u201d Anderle wrote. \u201cThe University has made a decision to deny John Doe the opportunity to enroll \u2026 [b]ut instead of making that decision based upon the facts, the law, and in fairness, it has decided to do it their own way.\u201d\u000a\u201cThe University\u2019s inaction over such a lengthy period of time, leaving Petitioner in limbo, is unreasonable and arbitrary,\u201d he said. The length of the investigation violated not only federal guidance but also multiple U.C. statutes and regulations.\u000aThe judge spared no criticism of the interim suspension itself, which he characterized as \u201cparticularly egregious given the University\u2019s delay in completion of its Title IX investigation, the dismissal of the juvenile court proceedings against Petitioner, and the seven month interruption in his education.\u201d\u000aBecause the student suffered \u201cirreparable harm\u201d at the hands of Vasquez and other officials, the judge explained, the student merited full judicial relief.\u000aIn her new position at Pitzer College, Vasquez is \u201cresponsible for enforcement of the Code of Student Conduct and for ensuring that the rights of all students are upheld.\u201d\u000aShe is also a Title IX coordinator, tasked with, among other things, \u201censuring prompt and equitable resolution of complaints.\u201d\u000aThe Independent has also learned that the student\u2019s case has been accepted by the Department of Education for investigation on the basis of potential Title IX and Title VI violations. Title IX \u201cprohibits discrimination on the basis of sex,\u201d while Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 \u201cprohibits discrimination on the basis of race, color or national origin,\u201d according to the Department of Education\u2019s website.\u000aOn that investigation, the student\u2019s San Diego-based attorney, Bob Ottilie, stated, \u201cWhile the specifics of the Department of Education investigation are confidential, I can confirm that Ms. Vasquez\u2019s conduct is a component.\u201d\u000aVasquez and Pitzer College officials have yet to respond to the Independent\u2019s requests for comment.

aS'Yes Means Yes, Obviously'
p75
aVThe moral climate of college is warped. On the one hand, it is a bit like living in the Scarlet Letter. Students are urged to repent for their race, gender, sexual preferences, etc., and to acknowledge and fear invisible bogeymen like the Cisheterowhitepatriarchy, which infect people, entire academic departments, and society at large. At the same time, so preoccupied with these ethereal yet all-powerful social constructions of their own invention, progressivism\u2019s true believers lose sight of the authentic evils in our world.\u000aOne of the most recent examples of this duality is The Student Life\u2019s November 10 op-ed entitled \u201cWhen Yes Means No.\u201d The author, Tiara Sharma, asserts that the Claremont Colleges\u2019 educational campaign against sexual assault on campus mistakenly designates some enthusiastic affirmative (such as \u201cYes!\u201d) as the dividing line between consensual sex and rape. She faults \u201c[p]olicies of affirmative consent\u201d for \u201cignor[ing] the frequency with which individuals consent out of fear, coercion, and past trauma.\u201d\u000aThe trouble, of course, is that the notion of affirmative consent being advanced on campuses across the country already accounts for these factors.\u000aEnd Rape on Campus, one of the foremost national advocates for affirmative consent policies, praised the passage of a 2014 California law that defined consent as \u201ca voluntary, affirmative, conscious, agreement to engage in sexual activity, that it can be revoked at any time, that a previous relationship does not constitute consent, and that coercion or threat of force can also not be used to establish consent.\u201d\u000aThis statute reflects the legal and conventional definitions of consent, which both capture the idea that, to be valid, consent requires certain antecedent conditions to hold, chief among which is the condition of agency. In order to hold me to my own decisions, it must be evident that I\u2014and not anyone else\u2014directed them.\u000aIf a robber holds me at gunpoint and asks me to sign over my property to him, and I do so, no one would argue that my signature constitutes a consenting act. Despite my signature on the page, it is clear to any reasonable person that it is the robber\u2019s weapon, and not my own will, that provides the decisive force. The challenge, of course, particularly in complicated cases involving sex, is locating the border between coercive and consensual acts.\u000aSharma seems to agree that when an individual is coerced, he/she cannot consent, regardless of whether he/she does state the contrary. At this point, however, her argument veers away from reality into the land of progressive fantasy. She expends hundreds of words explaining how the \u201ccis-heteropatriarchy can, and actually does, thrive within consensual sex,\u201d and how \u201ceven the \u2018most\u2019 consensual of sexual interactions \u2026 can perpetuate their own gendered power structures of dominance and submission.\u201d\u000aThe purpose of this word salad, it seems, is to explain that even run-of-the-mill sexual encounters are, in a sense, deeply coercive because they all, without exception, serve as \u201ca vehicle\u201d for multiple intersecting institutions of oppression\u2014such as the cis-heteropatriarchy. These institutions are so powerful and pervasive, she thinks, that they unavoidably diminish freedom of human choice. But if we take these tyrannous superstructures actually to coerce individual action, we must also accept that any human decision that implicates these structures\u2014from engaging in sexual contact to choosing a profession\u2014is performed under duress and thus cannot ever meet the standard of consent.\u000aTo her credit, Sharma, dimly sensing the unsettling possibilities this argument raises, takes care to say that \u201cthis is not to say that all sex is rape, nor to take agency from those who find sex empowering.\u201d Unfortunately, this is exactly the point to which her argument inevitably leads: When determinate coercive forces and \u201cviolent power dynamics\u201d of institutions of oppression pervade every sexual encounter, there is no room left for agency. On Sharma\u2019s premise, there is simply no way for a person to consent to sex, for duress is everywhere and unavoidable.\u000aPerhaps Sharma was well-intentioned in writing her piece. In any case, her self-proclaimed \u201ccomplete reconfiguration of the current paradigm\u201d minimizes the evil of sexual assault in favor of propagating the progressive myth of unrelenting institutional oppression.\u000aConsider the following: If it is the case that vast institutions of oppression render human agency inert, one could argue plausibly that rapists who have a claim to some kind of marginalization or status of victimhood are actually not responsible for committing rape.\u000aAnd in fact, many rapists do have a claim to this status. For example, sexual predators tend to have been victims of abusive home environments as children. Sad as this fact may be, it ought not erase the wrongfulness of their act\u2014yet Sharma\u2019s argument provides a clear pathway to doing just that, excusing and absolving their responsibility on account of their helplessness in the face of overwhelming misfortune. Such a conclusion is morally repugnant; we must reject it, as well as any arguments, like hers, that necessitate it.\u000aWe suggest that Sharma abandon her project to crush a fashionable bogeyman and instead take up the more difficult task of developing resources for victims, as well as concrete steps to take in order to reduce sexual assault on campus. As satisfying as it may be to inveigh against institutional oppression and to make victims out of the participants in any and every sexual encounter, these arguments ultimately only marginalize the trauma of real victims: the women and men who carry the unfathomable pain, shame, and sorrow of having their power of choice forcibly withdrawn and destroyed against their will\u2014not by the discarnate themes of a gender studies thesis, but by a friend, a neighbor, or a stranger.

aS'As CS Dept. Strains, Low-Demand Majors Awash in Professors'
p79
aVA student petition is asking Pomona College\u2014one of the member institutions of the Claremont Colleges\u2014to hire more computer science faculty in order to manage the drastic increase in the number of computer science graduates over the last few years.\u000aIn the meantime, however, unpopular and unemployable majors, such as Africana studies and gender studies, are awash with tenured faculty members.\u000aAccording to the petition, the amount of majors in computer science has increased tenfold in the graduating classes over the past six years\u2014from six to 60 students\u2014while tenure-track faculty has only increased from four to seven over the same time period, not counting faculty on leave.\u000aAs a result, many computer science students \u201cface significant enrollment pressure put many majors in danger of not graduating because students with earlier registration slots had grabbed all of the available slots.\u201d \u000aA lower faculty-to-student ratio has also increased class sizes, the petition states: \u201cTo accommodate our increased enrollment, we have been increasing class sizes.  The average class size at Pomona is 15, yet we have been teaching introductory level courses with enrollments typically in the upper 30s, 40s, and even low 50s.\u201d\u000aWhile popular and career-ready disciplines, especially computer science, have seen ballooning class sizes with limited response from the college, Gender & Women\u2019s Studies and ethnic studies departments at Pomona are awash with tenure-track professors.\u000aAfricana Studies, which only graduates around 2-3 majors a year\u2014less than 5% of of the 60 students computer science will be graduating this year\u2014boasts eight tenure-track faculty members, drawn from various disciplines, at Pomona alone, according to the department\u2019s website. Those figures give Africana Studies approximately a twenty-five fold advantage over computer science in terms of faculty to majors graduated. \u000aSimilarly, Gender and Women\u2019s Studies (GWS) at Pomona College has four tenure-track professors listed as faculty, along with 21 professors listed as \u201caffiliated faculty.\u201d Meanwhile, GWS graduates only approximately three majors a year, and is one of the most unemployable fields measured by salary. \u000aWhen the Independent reached out to Professor Yuqing Melanie Wu\u2014the computer science department head\u2014about low faculty numbers in comparison to other departments and its effects, Wu pointed to a private proposal that the computer science department submitted to Pomona College\u2019s Faculty Position Advisory Committee (FPAC).\u000aIn the proposal, the computer science department cited a pressing need to keep up with enrollment in computer science classes, as well as large class sizes\u2014of which \u201c1/3 of all CS lectures have more than 40 students [much larger than Pomona\u2019s average lecture size]\u201d\u2014as affecting teaching quality. \u000aAccording to the proposal, the department \u201cworr[ies] that the lack of personal attention [due to lack of faculty] has a negative impact on students overall, and particularly students from URM [underrepresented minority] groups.\u201d The number of students is also constrained by physical space available in the computer labs. \u000aComputer science students at Pomona seem to agree that more CS faculty are desperately needed, citing the impact of the small faculty on their educational experience.\u000aLevente Papp (PO \u201820), a sophomore computer science student\u2014told the Independent that \u201c[m]any of us [students] decided to come to a liberal arts college because we were hoping to have a more personal learning experience here, but this is in danger now. Personally, I don\u2019t mind having 40 or 50 students in a lecture, but when you [as a major] can\u2019t get into your desired classes and when you can\u2019t get the necessary help in office hours or mentor sessions because of the number of students, that\u2019s a problem.\u201d\u000aComputer science as a discipline also requires a favorable faculty-to-student ratio, according to Papp: \u201cLearning CS involves a lot of trying and failing, so it would require a good amount of close mentoring, which is now being compromised due to the decreasing faculty-to-student ratio.\u201d\u000aThe computer science department\u2019s proposal to the college\u2019s FPAC also highlights the impact of \u201cthe sense of belonging of many students\u201d in larger classes, which \u201cusually has a more significant impact on women and URM students.\u201d\u000aWhile both the petition and the department\u2019s proposal to the FPAC ask for more full-time tenure-track faculty in the light of phased retirement of two faculty members in the next two years\u2014bringing down the number of tenure-track computer science faculty to four, the same number as Gender and Women\u2019s Studies faculty\u2014and with the proposal explicitly stating that tenure-track faculty ared need to \u201cfunction as a healthy academic unit,\u201d it remains to be seen whether the college will fulfill those requests.\u000aShare this:Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)MoreClick to print (Opens in new window)Click to share on Pinterest (Opens in new window)Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)Click to share on Google+ (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Tags: Africana Studies claremont Claremont Colleges computer science Ethnic Studies Faculty Shortage Gender studies pomona college SJWCategories: Campus News

aS'Student Op-Ed: Outdoor Clubs Are Too White'
p83
aVIn an opinion editorial for the Student Life, the administration-funded student newspaper at the Claremont Colleges, a white Pitzer student frets that the colleges\u2019 outdoor programs, though open to all students and well-funded, are \u201cpredominantly white spaces\u201d that deny people of color \u201caccess to the outdoors.\u201d\u000aThe article, written by Malcolm McCann, a freshman at Pitzer College\u2014one of the member institutions of the Claremont Colleges\u2014calls out clubs like Pitzer Outdoor Adventure (POA) and On the Loose (OTL), among the most amply funded outdoor clubs at the Claremont Colleges, for being \u201cpredominately white spaces.\u201d\u000a\u201cBoth clubs claim to be accessible: while trips are open to any student wanting to go, not everyone feels the same ease in entering the outdoors. This discomfort is unfortunately caused by existing racial boundaries,\u201d McCann proposed.\u000aThe article helpfully explains that white imperialism, as well as the fact that three prominent naturalist figures in U.S. history happen to be white, generate this pervasive racial exclusion:\u000a\u201cHistorically, white people in imperialist conquests have appropriated land as their own. North America rightfully belongs to indigenous communities, yet it has been taken away from them by force. Consequently, a false sense of ownership of nature permeates white America.\u201d\u000a\u201cSimilarly, the image of a modern outdoor enthusiasts is white, as is the historical image of a naturalist. The great icons of nature \u2013 John Muir, Walt Whitman, Henry David Thoreau \u2013 are all white men. At present, most famous rock climbers are also disproportionately white,\u201d McCann wrote. \u000aThe author takes the term \u201coutdoorsy\u201d as another expression of \u201cwhiteness\u201d that excludes people of color from outdoor activities.\u000a\u201cThis whiteness manifests in the term \u201coutdoorsy\u201d \u2013 a descriptor for those who spend a significant time in the outdoors, who are equipped with the necessary gear, and who feel connected to nature,\u201d he says. \u201cThe image of the \u201coutdoorsy individual\u201d is an exclusive classification that gives white people the authority to venture into the outdoors freely, leaving people of color behind.\u201d\u000aMcCann also points to financial barriers preventing students of color from spending time outdoors. \u201cMany National Parks are hundreds of miles from large cities. Consequently, only those with access to a vehicle and money for gas will be able to enjoy them\u201d he explains. \u201cSimilarly, only students with economic privilege have the resources to attend summer programs that teach wilderness skills.\u201d\u000aHe adds that the \u201cemphasis on acquiring requisite skills \u2026 excludes low-income individuals.\u201d\u000aThe Claremont Colleges\u2019 outdoor clubs, however, are extremely well-funded, as McCann concedes, and students\u2019 financial barriers usually are surmounted with the assistance of college funding. In addition to heavily subsidized transportation options for students making their own trips to the outdoors, Pomona College\u2019s outdoor club sponsors several free or nearly-free trips a year, as well as loaning gear to any 5C student at no charge.\u000aAt Claremont McKenna College, the Outdoor Initiative organizes and funds several outdoor camping trips during holidays like Thanksgiving and Fall Break. At Pitzer College, the \u201cPitzer Outdoor Adventure\u201d club of which McCann is a member began this school year with over $7,500 of funding.\u000aMcCann suggests several solutions to the inclusivity crisis he claims to identify in his article. Among these are affirming that \u201cnature exists as a collective space owned by all by virtue of being human, not by virtue of being white,\u201d having \u201cmore accessible, entry-level workshops and trips that do not require advanced technical skills,\u201d and encouraging white people not to exert domination of the word \u201coutdoorsy.\u201d\u000aMcCann\u2019s outcry against outdoor clubs and activities is not the first to come out of the Claremont Colleges\u2014last year a speedo hike organized by the On the Loose outdoors club of the Claremont Colleges was cancelled over concerns of \u201cbody image\u201d and \u201cbro-iness.\u201d\u000aInterestingly, McCann is a white student, sporting hiking gear in his Facebook profile photo. When asked for further information, McCann asked to remain off the record, and did not address whether he is part of the problem he identifies.

aS'Student Group Blasts College for Admitting Too Few Convicts'
p87
aVAn unnamed student group is attacking Pomona College for its \u201cadmission policy that allows for discrimination\u201d against former convicts, claiming that the \u201cfacts\u201d surrounding a person\u2019s incarceration \u201cdon\u2019t always tell the full story\u201d and \u201cmight not account for structures that either privilege or police certain individuals.\u201d\u000aIn a series of college-approved posters affixed earlier today across the campus of the elite liberal arts college, the group urges students to consider how \u201cthe voices of incarcerated leaders, scholars, artists, and engaged members\u201d are \u201cbarred, silenced, and suppressed by Pomona\u2019s admission policy.\u201d\u000aThe group also encourages students to question free speech protections, which are regarded as an affirmation of whiteness.\u000aReferencing a statement from former Pomona College president David Oxtoby, which defended free speech in the aftermath of the April 2017 protest of conservative, pro-police scholar Heather Mac Donald, the group asks: \u201cWhy does Pomona College legitimate the speech of those whose words continues [sic] to construct and uphold the white supremacy it claims to condemn, when Pomona has the ability to amplify the speech of incarcerated individuals whose voices are systematically silenced?\u201d\u000aQuoting James Cone, a black scholar, the students continue that \u201cwhat is wrong with America is \u2026 its belief that persons can affirm whiteness and humanity at the same time.\u201d\u000aA second poster cites an email from an unnamed campus administrator detailing the college\u2019s policy on admitting incarcerated students.\u000a\u201cOur policy is to take all the information in the application into account,\u201d the cited email states. \u201cAs with any piece of information in the application the entire Admissions Committee would evaluate the circumstances surrounding [an applicant\u2019s criminal] offense, as well as the applicant\u2019s response to the questions in the application, and we would make a judgment using all the facts presented, in addition to assessing the applicant\u2019s potential for success at Pomona.\u201d\u000aAccording to the student group, this email illustrates that the college can engage in unjust discrimination.\u000a\u201cInjustice often hides in plain sight, in \u2018common sense\u2019 statements about circumstances, and facts,\u201d the group writes, captioning the school\u2019s email. \u201cLanguage has a way of making injustice seem \u2018normal,\u2019 and thus acceptable, to those who are privileged enough to have it stay out of their way. The \u2018facts\u2019 don\u2019t always tell the full story. The \u2018circumstances\u2019 might not account for structures that either privilege or police certain individuals.\u201d\u000a\u201cPomona College claims that a criminal record \u2018does not disqualify\u2019 a person from admittance. At the same time, they write that they will \u2018make a judgment using all the facts presented.\u2019 What this really says: Pomona can discriminate against an admission applicant for having a criminal record,\u201d the caption concludes.\u000aAnother poster suggests that Pomona\u2019s policy on admitting former convicts demonstrates the college\u2019s lack of commitment to diversity, and asks: \u201cWhy does Pomona subject formerly incarcerated people to further extrajudicial discrimination?\u201d\u000aThe posters contain a link (PDF version here) to an online statement, in which the student group explains that its aim is to \u201craise significant awareness\u201d of the college\u2019s \u201cadmissions policy that allows for discrimination against individuals who have been incarcerated.\u201d\u000a\u201cWe aim to destabilize Pomona College\u2019s representation of itself by drawing attention to who is not addressed in statements put forth to produce and promote Pomona\u2019s image,\u201d the students write. \u201cWe have chosen the format of posters placed strategically across campus because we want to denaturalize the physical space of campus to provoke people who are a part of this institution to consider, if they have not already, what experiences and perspectives may not be as represented.\u201d\u000aThe students hope that \u201cthose who read the posters will be led to question the structural underpinnings of their own path to Pomona.\u201d\u000aCurrent and former Pomona students had mixed reactions to the campus postings.\u000a\u201cOur criminal justice system is inequitable, and no college should discriminate against applicants based on having a record alone,\u201d said Kate Dolgenos (PO \u201817), in a message to the Independent. \u201cHowever, given the severity of some criminal charges, the college should be able to factor in criminal records when they evaluate applicants.\u201d\u000aPomona senior Jerry Yan (\u201818) expressed similar sentiments.\u000a\u201cI agree with the group\u2019s premise that hearing from formerly incarcerated persons can be valuable and can go a long way in furthering Pomona\u2019s self-professed mission of creating a diverse campus environment that exposes students to a range of different perspectives,\u201d Yan told the Independent.\u000a\u201cThat said, the context matters a great deal; I imagine that many would be uncomfortable attending college with someone who has an extensive history of sexual assault, for example. But if the admissions office believes that a deserving applicant who has a prior criminal record has taken the appropriate steps to move on or that the nature of the applicant\u2019s prior conduct does not merit serious concern, then by all means the applicant should be admitted. I would look forward to meeting such a person, and hearing what they have to share,\u201d he continued.\u000aPomona College\u2019s Office of Admissions has yet to respond to the Independent\u2019s request for comment.

aVScripps College is hosting and funding a three-day speakers\u2019 series with a Venezuelan government official to valorize that country\u2019s totalitarian regime and spread awareness of the \u201ctruth in today\u2019s Venezuela,\u201d whitewashing the ruling regime\u2019s extensive human rights abuses, the Independent has learned.\u000aThe series, which ends on Wednesday, features Antonio Cordero, who serves as a Consul General of Nicholas Maduro\u2019s authoritarian government and has been a business director for \u201cvarious People\u2019s Power enterprises,\u201d according to an event advertisement.\u000aOne event in the series will focus on Maduro\u2019s new assembly\u2014the product of a rigged election that prompted the U.S. to institute economic sanctions against the Maduro regime\u2014and explain how it expresses the \u201cPEOPLE\u2019S POWER in Venezuela, the Highest Power in the Land.\u201d\u000aOther events will whitewash the dictator\u2019s imprisonment of political opponents and blame the slaughter of political protesters by Maduro\u2019s government on his \u201crightwing\u201d opposition.\u000aThree Scripps programs and departments\u2014Core, History, and Latin American & Caribbean Studies\u2014are listed as sponsors of the series. In an email to the Independent, Andrew Aisenberg, the chair of the college\u2019s history department, confirmed that \u201cthe history department did provide financial support for the Venezuela events.\u201d Additionally, at least some Scripps students are required to attend this speakers\u2019 series or an unrelated talk later in the week.\u000aPeople line up for blocks for a chance to enter a local supermarket in Venezuela. (Photo: Flickr)\u000aA flyer for the first event recites several Maduro government talking points, dismissing, without providing evidence, documentation by human rights organizations and international media of massive irregularities in both the Maduro-backed July vote for a constitutional assembly and the regional elections held in the middle of this month:\u000a\u201cVenezuela, with an electoral system that experts believe to be the most transparent in the world, registers an overwhelming win for socialists in gubernatorial elections of October 15.

aS'CMC Decides Against Quashing Christian Student Group'
p95
aVThis evening, the President of the Associated Students of Claremont McKenna College (ASCMC)\u2014the college\u2019s student government\u2014released an email to the student body of Claremont McKenna College announcing that the Claremont College\u2019s local chapter of InterVarsity\u20145CIV\u2014was no longer under review. Previously, ASCMC had defunded 5CIV and planned to vote on the potential dissolution of the Christian fellowship organization in their next Executive Board meeting on October 22nd. In addition to being free from the threat of dissolution, 5CIV has been encouraged to apply for funding in the spring semester. \u000aIn his email, the President of ASCMC stated that the Student Senate had been concerned that InterVarsity, as a national organization, excluded LGBTQIA+ members from leadership roles. However, he went on to clarify that this turned out to be a reiteration of InterVarsity\u2019s theological position on human sexuality. The statement in question\u2014which InterVarsity released last year\u2014acknowledged \u201cthat LGBTQI people have experienced great pain, including much caused by Christians\u201d and stated that InterVarsity \u201ccontinue[s] to employ individuals who have an LGBTQI identity and who affirm our theological beliefs around human sexuality.\u201d\u000aThe President of ASCMC went on to write: \u201cThe initial concern was that if such a statement did come from InterVarsity Christian Fellowship, students of the LGBTQIA+ community who espouse the Christian faith would be excluded from joining or performing leadership roles in the Claremont 5CIV organization.\u201d\u000aHe explained that, upon reviewing the situation with Nyree Gray, Assistant Vice President for Diversity and Inclusion, and Devon MacIver, Assistant Dean of Students for Student Activities and Orientation, ASCMC found \u201cno cases reported in which students at CMC have been unwelcome by 5CIV.\u201d Therefore, the 5CIV was found not to be in violation of the school\u2019s non-discrimination clause.\u201d\u000aKate Vosburg, 5CIV\u2019s Staff Minister, told the Independent that 5CIV leaders contacted Ms. Gray earlier this week regarding ASCMC\u2019s upcoming vote. Ms. Gray had been previously unaware of the situation, including ASCMC\u2019s denial of funding to 5CIV. \u000aAccording to Vosburg, after Ms. Gray had reviewed the situation in full, she \u201crespectfully and clearly\u201d explained to ASCMC that it did not have the authority to derecognize 5CIV, as it was a 5C club. Moreover, Ms. Gray stated that no student organization could be dissolved for its religious beliefs so long as it affirmed the non-discrimination clause and abided by other campus rules\u2026ASCMC senators were receptive to what she said and ready to change their actions accordingly.\u201d   \u000a\u201cI\u2019m grateful that the basic American liberties of freedom of religion and freedom of assembly have been preserved at the Claremont Colleges.\u201d Vosburg stated, \u201cThis is not just good for 5CIV. This is good for all other religious groups and for groups who represent a minority group or opinion.  The administration has preserved space for diversity of beliefs at Claremont which is essential for Claremont to be a place of higher learning.\u201d\u000aClaremont McKenna College (CMC) is part of the Claremont Colleges Consortium, which includes four other undergraduate institutions: Pomona College, Scripps College, Harvey Mudd College, and Pitzer College.\u000aThe body of the ASCMC President\u2019s email can be found below:

aS'Student Government May Dissolve Christian Student Group'
p99
aVIn a meeting last Monday, Claremont McKenna College\u2019s student senate\u2014the Associated Students of Claremont McKenna College (ASCMC)\u2014met with representatives from 5C InterVarsity (5CIV), the Claremont College\u2019s local chapter of a national evangelical Christian fellowship organization\u2014InterVarsity (IVCF)\u2014and proposed dissolving 5CIV\u2019s club charter.\u000a5CIV is a student run-Christian fellowship organization that organizes and hosts small-group Bible studies during the week for students of the Claremont Colleges, of which CMC is a member institution. Their stated purpose is \u201cto establish and advance at the 5Cs [Claremont Colleges] a witnessing community of students and faculty who follow Jesus as Lord and Savior: growing in love for God, God\u2019s word, God\u2019s people of every ethnicity and culture and God\u2019s purposes in the world.\u201d\u000aOne of 5CIV\u2019s leaders told the Independent that 5CIV was only notified of the meeting and the topic for discussion minutes before it commenced. At the meeting, which three 5CIV leaders attended, one student senator referred to the Christian students in 5CIV as \u201ccowards,\u201d while in a private conversation outside of the meeting, another student senator compared 5CIV to the Ku Klux Klan.\u000aThe sharp invective reflected the swirl of rumor and myth that has surrounded 5CIV\u2019s membership policies over the past few years. IVCF\u20145CIV\u2019s national parent organization\u2014requires that paid leaders of its local chapters agree with its conception of Christian theology, which includes a traditional stance on sex outside of a monogamous, heterosexual marriage.\u000a\u201cInterVarsity believes Christlikeness includes both embracing Scripture\u2019s teachings on human sexuality as well as defending the dignity of all people, including LGBTQI individuals, because they are made in God\u2019s image,\u201d IVCF\u2019s website explained.\u000aThough this rule only governs organization leadership, and is neither a membership qualification\u2014non-leading members may hold whatever views they wish\u2014nor exclusionary of any identities, some student senators have taken this rule to mean that gays and lesbians are excluded from group membership.\u000aKate Vosburg, 5CIV\u2019s Staff Minister, told the Independent that the student members of 5CIV spent much of the meeting with student senators dispelling false allegations about the organization, its views on LGBTQ people, and the actual national policy to which the organization adheres.\u000a\u201cOne rumor is that 5CIV leaders are required to sign a pledge that they\u2019re not LGBTQ. That never has been the case, nor will it ever be,\u201d she said. \u201cAnother rumor was that 5CIV does not allow LGBTQ students into membership or leadership, or that 5CIV does not allow theologically-affirming students as members or leaders. Again, that is not true and will not be true.\u201d \u000a\u201cAll students are welcome to 5CIV and leadership qualifications do not include questions of sexuality,\u201d Vosburg continued. \u000aAnother popular myth that 5CIV had to deflect was the rumor \u201cthat IVCF nationally does not hire LGBTQ people.\u201d\u000aAccording to Vosburg, \u201c[t]his again is blatantly false. IVCF has, does, and will continue to hire LGBTQ Christians to serve as IV staff. The policy in question is about theological qualifications for being hired; it is NOT about one\u2019s orientation or identity.\u201d\u000aOn Sunday, according to 5CIV members, the student senate will have another open hearing on this matter.\u000aIt is unclear that ASCMC has the power to dissolve 5CIV\u2019s charter or what that dissolution would mean for the organization. ASCMC already decided to withhold money from 5CIV for the 2017-2018 school year, after funding InterVarsity for many years, due to the unfounded rumors surrounding InterVarsity\u2019s hiring policies.\u000aVosburg speculates that future action \u201cwould mean that we could not host 5CIV events at CMC. It would certainly mean that we would get no funding.\u201d \u000aAccording to the Claremont Colleges handbook for student organizations, an organization may be suspended or lose recognition if it violates the nondiscrimination clause, fails a financial audit, and/or fails basic registration requirements.\u000a5CIV must also adhere to the \u201cInterfaith Chaplaincy of the Claremont Colleges Guidelines for Student Organizations.\u201d The handbook does not state that having a charter dissolved by a student senate of any of the Claremont Colleges could lead to suspension or loss of recognition for the club. \u000aA move to dissolve 5CIV\u2019s charter at CMC would have some precedent. Last fall, ASHMC\u2014the student senate of Harvey Mudd College, another member institution of the Claremont Colleges\u2014gave 5CIV provisional recognition while it considered whether 5CIV should have exemption from the nondiscrimination clause as a religious organization on the basis that IVCF\u2019s hiring policies requires group leaders to agree with a certain conception of the Christian faith.

aS'\xe2\x80\x9cAnti-Muslim\xe2\x80\x9d Dissenters Disrupt Scripps Open Lecture '
p107
aVOn Tuesday afternoon, during an open lecture at Scripps College, several attendees unaffiliated with the college challenged the lecturer to explain his views about Islamist terrorism and President Trump\u2019s immigration policies, sparking half an hour of testy debate that culminated in an email from a Scripps dean providing resources to students traumatized by the exchange.\u000aThe lecture, part of Scripps\u2019s Tuesday Noon Academy speaker series held in conjunction with the Scripps Humanities Institute, was on the subject of American-Islamic Relations and xenophobic rhetoric in the wake of the 2016 presidential election.\u000aA video taken by an audience member shows one of the dissenters asking the speaker\u2014Hussam Ayloush, Executive Director of the Los Angeles chapter of the Council of American-Islamic Relations (CAIR-LA)\u2014if CAIR disavows suicide bombings.\u000aThe exchange devolved into a shouting match between the dissenter and Professor Hao Huang, the director of the Scripps Humanities Institute, who told the man, \u201cyou don\u2019t belong here if you can\u2019t shut up. Shut up!\u201d\u000aComposed throughout the exchange, Ayloush responded that \u201cas a Muslim, I cannot enter paradise if I didn\u2019t believe in the sanctity of life,\u201d but refrained from offering a yes or no answer to the question.\u000aIn a later exchange a different dissenter berated a Scripps student for being brainwashed.\u000aThroughout the question and answer period like-minded attendees variously volunteered their concerns about community safety\u2014\u201cI have Jewish friends who didn\u2019t want to come here today because they were afraid for their safety\u201d\u2014and their dissatisfaction with Ayloush characterizing President Trump\u2019s travel ban as a \u201cMuslim ban.\u201d\u000a\u201c[Trump\u2019s travel ban] was not a Muslim ban; it was a travel ban!\u201d one attendee said to the speaker. \u201cYou\u2019re a bigot and a liar.\u201d\u000aAt the conclusion of the question-and-answer session, one of the dissenters accused Ayloush of deception: \u201cYou can\u2019t have a dialogue when lying at every step of the argument.\u201d\u000aSeveral student attendees walked out during the hostilities. \u000aAccording to the event description, the purpose of the lecture was to discuss how \u201c[t]he xenophobic rhetoric of the 2016 presidential election has only intensified since Donald Trump took office, and campaign promises have manifested into tangible policies and executive orders that have stalled immigration applications, torn families apart, grounded travelers, and instilled fear in entire immigrant communities throughout the nation.\u201d\u000aThe description also condemned President Trump\u2019s language and policies pertaining to the \u201cMuslim Ban,\u201d and contended that Ayloush would \u201ctrace the evolution of Islamophobic policies from the fringe to the mainstream, showing how presidential decrees like the Muslim Ban actually have precedents that are decades old.\u201d\u000aHussam Ayloush is no stranger to controversy. Last December he issued an apology for an ill-conceived tweet about a Russian military jet that crashed on its way to war torn Syria: \u201cI\u2019m sad about the crashed Russian military jet. The Tu-154 could have carried up to 180 military personnel instead of just 92!\u201d he had written.\u000aShortly after the incident at the lecture, Scripps Vice President for Student Affairs and Dean of Students Charlotte Johnson issued an email statement noting the availability of resources for students impacted by the \u201canti-Muslim and anti-immigrant\u201d comments, \u201cwhich are in direct conflict with our shared values.\u201d\u000aDean Johnson added that members of the Scripps community who felt targeted by race, religion, ancestry, age, among other identities, \u201cmay contact our Title IX office and make a complaint under Scripps College\u2019s harassment and discrimination policy.\u201d\u000aScripps College\u2019s student government\u2014Scripps Associated Students (SAS)\u2014also issued a statement, condemning \u201cthese sentiments of islamophobia and hatred. We offer warm thoughts and support to those who were affected by these events.\u201d\u000aScripps College\u2014along with Pitzer College, Claremont McKenna College, Pomona College, and Harvey Mudd College\u2014is a member of the Claremont University Consortium.\u000aThe body of Dean Johnson\u2019s email is included below:

aS'Student Senate Seeks to Erase Columbus Day'
p111
aVOn Saturday, Pomona College\u2019s student government\u2014the Associated Students of Pomona College (ASPC)\u2014and its president Maria Vides introduced a resolution into the ASPC Senate seeking to \u201cInstitutionally Recognize Indigenous People\u2019s Day\u201d in lieu of Columbus Day, a federal holiday.\u000aThe resolution states that \u201cstudents, faculty, and staff at the intersections have had and will presumably continue to have cause to demonstrate in order to ensure Indigenous tribes globally are recognized, especially those impacted by the consequences of Columbus\u2019 arrival to the Americas and the history of colonization that followed. We express solidarity with and encourage participation in institutional, local, national, and international movements for justice regarding Indigenous People\u2019s history and rights.\u201d\u000aThe resolution seeks to follow in the footsteps of several other colleges including Pitzer College, Stanford University, Yale University, Brown University, Cornell University, Hamilton College, and Occidental College.  \u000a\u201cFive U.S. States formally do not celebrate Columbus Day, and 39 U.S. cities have passed legislation to celebrate Indigenous People\u2019s Day in lieu of Columbus Day,\u201d the resolution asserts, before asking the college to institutionally recognize Indigenous People\u2019s Day. \u000aThe resolution would also remove all mentions of Columbus Day from \u201cthe academic calendar distributed to students at the start of the academic year, and all other official documents.\u201d\u000aIn a message to the Independent, a student of Native American descent stated that \u201cPomona College doesn\u2019t honor our veterans during the year, and with this move, the student senate has shown that it doesn\u2019t value dialogue about our nation\u2019s history either.\u201d\u000a\u201cDrafting students into a forced veneration of my indigenous culture is wrong and inappropriately shifts the focus away from a critical debate about Columbus as a man and a defining figure in our history. Paying lip service to my culture and ignoring Columbus is par for the course for a student senate that would rather pretend Columbus didn\u2019t exist than to assess his humanity in any remotely complex way,\u201d he added. \u000aOther students from the Claremont Colleges\u2014a university consortium of which Pomona College is a part\u2014differed, with one sophomore from Scripps College telling the Independent that she \u201cthink[s] that [Indigenous People\u2019s Day] [is] a smart idea; considering that most of the administration on most campuses have already expressed dissent about Columbus Day\u2026 I think that it\u2019s the natural action for the other 5C\u2019s [Claremont Colleges] to follow Pomona\u2019s lead.\u201d\u000a\u201c[I]t is necessary to officially replace it so that students don\u2019t just let the day pass without thinking of the importance of [Columbus] on indigenous people,\u201d she said.\u000aColumbus Day is recognized by the state of California. A bill to replace Columbus Day with \u201cNative American Day\u201d was proposed but did not pass in 2013.  \u000aPomona College is part of the Claremont Colleges Consortium, which also includes Claremont McKenna College, Scripps College, Harvey Mudd and Pitzer College. Only Pitzer College has adopted Indigenous People\u2019s Day.\u000aASPC President Maria Vides did not offer a comment to the Independent at the time of publication.  \u000aNote: The resolution linked in the article is a live document that is constantly being updated with comments.

aVAfter discovering a student-run meme page that contained \u201cdeplorable\u201d and \u201cdeeply offensive\u201d pictures and text, Pomona College launched a \u201cBias-Incident Response Team,\u201d which quickly concluded that the meme page constitutes a \u201cbias-related incident.\u201d\u000aThe college, however, has very limited legal grounds for action against the students in the group\u2014even those who posted the most offensive content\u2014due to a certain California law that extends federal First Amendment protections to all students at higher education institutions, public and private alike.\u000aPomona College deems an incident \u201cbias-related\u201d when it expresses \u201chostility against another individual (or group) because of the other person\u2019s (or group\u2019s) race, color, religion [etc.] \u2026 or because the perpetrator perceives that the other person (or group) has one or more of these characteristics.\u201d\u000aIn his email discussing the college\u2019s decision, Dean Ric Townes did remind the recipients of his email that \u201c[d]epending on the circumstances, a bias-related incident may not be a crime and may be protected speech.\u201d\u000aHe also revealed, however, that the incident is still under review \u201cwith regard to the Student Code or other policy violation,\u201d implying that the college may have some kind of authority over the content of a private meme page to which many of its students belonged.\u000aThis implication opens a number of critical questions: What is protected speech in a California private college? How much jurisdiction does a California private college have concerning speech policy violations? And, what sort of punishments can the college administer in response to \u201cbias-related incidents\u201d?\u000aIn 1992, the Leonard Law\u2014named for its author, State Senator Bill Leonard\u2014was passed by the California State Legislature. This law extends the First Amendment and the California Constitution\u2019s protections of freedom of speech to students at private colleges in California.\u000a\u201cNo private postsecondary educational institution shall make or enforce a rule subjecting a student to disciplinary sanctions solely on the basis of conduct that is speech or other communication that, when engaged in outside the campus or facility of a private postsecondary institution, is protected from governmental restriction by the First Amendment to the United States Constitution or Section 2 of Article I of the California Constitution.\u201d\u000aIn light of this law, Pomona College would need to show either that the content on the meme page is unprotected by the First Amendment or the California Constitution, or, alternatively, that the content constitutes \u201chate violence.\u201d\u000aThree classes of unprotected speech are relevant to the case at hand. The first is speech classed as \u201cincitement\u201d\u2014speech that is both \u201cdirected at inciting or producing imminent lawless action\u201d and \u201clikely to incite or produce such action,\u201d as established in Brandenburg v. Ohio.\u000aThe second is the category of \u201cfighting words,\u201d which are words that \u201ctend to incite an immediate breach of the peace,\u201d as determined in Chaplinsky v. New Hampshire.\u000aLast is the category of words with \u201cthe intent to intimidate,\u201d which were ruled unprotected under the First Amendment in Virginia v. Black.\u000aOne of the exceptions of Leonard Law is that it \u201cdoes not prohibit an institution from adopting rules and regulations that are designed to prevent hate violence, as defined in subdivision (a) of Section 4 of Chapter 1363 of the Statutes of 1992.\u201d\u000aThe Statutes of 1992 define \u201chate violence\u201d as follows: \u201cany act of physical intimidation or physical harassment, physical force or physical violence that is directed against any person or group of persons, or the property of any person or group of persons because of the ethnicity, race, national, origin, religion, sex, sexual orientation, disability, or political or religious beliefs of that person or group.\u201d\u000a\u201cActs shall not be considered \u2018hate violence\u2019\u2026 based on speech alone,\u201d the statute clarifies, \u201cexcept upon a showing that the speech itself threatens violence against a specific person or group of persons, that the person or group of persons against whom the threat is directed reasonably fears that the violence will be committed because of the speech, and that the person threatening violence had the apparent ability to carry out that threat.\u201d\u000aUnder Pomona\u2019s speech policy, an act of speech either must constitute a threat of violence or must meet all three of the following standards in order to be proscribed:\u000a\u201c(1) the speech, considered objectively, is abusive and insulting rather than a communication of ideas,\u000a(2) the speech is directed at an individual and actually used in an abusive manner in a situation that presents an actual danger that it will cause an immediate breach of the peace by inciting a violent reaction by the individual to whom the speech is addressed and,\u000a(3) the student intends the speech to be abusive and insulting rather than a communication of ideas.\u201d (emphasis added)\u000aFrom what I have seen of the most egregious contents of said Facebook group (view here), the meme group has violated none of the above speech codes. The images and jokes on the page cannot in any way be reasonably interpreted as incitement to lawlessness or to a breach of the peace, as intimidation, as harassment, or as a threat of violence.\u000aSo, why does the Pomona College administration not come out and state the obvious? Is it because they are not aware of the Leonard Law? Not aware of what constitutes unprotected speech? Do they intend to challenge the Leonard Law in the Supreme Court? Or rather, do they have other, more political, reasons for failing to level with their student body about the college\u2019s actual authority over student speech?\u000aIf the answer is ignorance, then Pomona\u2019s administration is not the only party that fails to grasp the legal protections to which California college students are entitled. The coverage of \u2018Memegate\u2019 has also failed to discuss the implications of the Leonard Law and has emphasized the possibility of disciplinary action despite the college\u2019s limited powers.\u000aIn an article published by Inside Higher Ed this week in response to the meme page and Pomona\u2019s investigation, Kevin Kruger\u2014the President of NASPA, \u201cthe leading association for the advancement, health, and sustainability of the student affairs profession\u201d\u2014said that \u201cI think it would be hard, but not impossible, to take action simply on the basis of a student participating in the group, or even posting an offensive meme, if that meme was not in and of itself threatening or harassing to an individual.\u201d (emphasis added)\u000aTeen Vogue\u2019s article about the meme group claimed that \u201cif the university [sic] decides that the meme group does fall within their bias incident rules, the students may be fully penalized.\u201d \u000aSimilarly, Ross Steinberg claimed in his exposé of the group that \u201cThe Pomona College Code lists as violations acts of speech where \u2018the student intends the speech to be abusive and insulting rather than a communication of ideas\u2019 as well as when, \u2018the speech, considered objectively, is abusive and insulting rather than a communication of ideas.\u2019\u201d\u000aBut, importantly, such communications are not violations unless they also constitute an \u201cactual danger\u201d to its addressee. Steinberg entirely omitted this critical point from his discussion of the policy.\u000aAll of these characterizations of the college\u2019s legal powers and of the purpose of the incident response team are inaccurate. The college\u2019s own policy fully acknowledges that, even if speech is determined to be a \u201cbias incident,\u201d the speech in question may still be protected by law and therefore cannot legally be subject to any sanction whatsoever.\u000aIf these people are simply misinformed or uninformed, then the best I can do is to point out where they have erred. Pomona College, however, has a responsibility to its students to be entirely transparent about the extent of their ability, as a California college, to punish students for their speech. They have an obligation to inform their students of their rights\u2014whether the college agrees with their speech or not.\u000aI can only conclude that, in omitting this critical information, Pomona\u2019s administrators intend one of two things: either they desire that students perceive them to have authority where they in fact have none, or they are attempting to satisfy a certain political narrative popular among their student body, a narrative in which to defend freedom of speech is to endorse the \u201chateful\u201d or \u201coffensive\u201d speech that this fundamental right protects.\u000aIn the wake of the college\u2019s decision not to punish Pomona students who created an illicit blockade at Claremont McKenna College last semester, my hope is that our new president, Gabi Starr, reaffirms David Oxtoby\u2019s commitment to \u201cthe exercise of free speech,\u201d which our former president made in an email sent out concerning the Athenaeum affair last semester. To be silent is a disservice to her students, who are legally entitled to free speech, but who may not be aware of their rights and fear repercussions for exercising them.

aS'MEMEGATE: Pomona Declares Anti-PC Meme Group "Bias-Related Incident"'
p123
aVThis afternoon, in an email to the Pomona College community, Dean Ric Townes reported that Pomona College is investigating an anti-PC meme-sharing Facebook group for the \u201cdeeply offensive memes\u201d posted therein.\u000a\u201cAs stated in the Student Handbook, Pomona defines incidents as bias-related when they \u201care expressions of hostility against another individual (or group) because of the other person\u2019s (or group\u2019s) race, color, religion, ancestry, national origin, disability, gender identity or expression and sexual orientation,\u201d Dean Townes wrote, \u201cor because the perpetrator perceives that the other person (or group) has one or more of these characteristics.\u201d\u000a\u201cBased on these criteria, the IRT has determined that the posts to the meme group rise to the level of a bias-related incident and with regard to the Student Code or other policy violation, the matter is still being reviewed,\u201d he continued. \u201cWe will report to the community when that review is concluded.\u201d\u000aA member of the Facebook group under investigation told the Independent that the group \u201cis aimed at free speech primarily and contains a range of political views and backgrounds of students.\u201d\u000aThe Leonard Law in California applies First Amendment protection to speech at all private and public high schools and higher education institutions, including the Claremont Colleges.\u000aThe full text of Dean Townes\u2019 email is included below.

aS'Statement Regarding Dismissal of Ross Steinberg'
p127
aVWe are committed to thoughtful, independent journalism, and we stand by the right of Mr. Steinberg to be heard.\u000aWhen Mr. Steinberg brought this article idea to our attention, he included with it a threat that, if we were to decline to publish his article, he would publish at an outlet that would permit him to disclose the names of the individuals involved with the page.\u000aMr. Steinberg made this demand with full knowledge that a number of individuals on our staff were involved with the meme page and, like most of the 300+ members of the page, to a minimal extent, if at all.\u000aThough we had no plan to reject his article on this basis, his demand, in light of the circumstances, struck the board as unprofessional and extortionate.\u000aFollowing publication, in a comment on a public Facebook post, Mr. Steinberg disclosed the contents of private deliberations of the Independent\u2019s editorial board without the consent of his fellow board members.\u000aThe actions described above provoked substantial resentment within the board and the Independent\u2019s staff. When our editor-in-chief urged Mr. Steinberg to take some time away from meetings in order to facilitate the resolution of this internal conflict, stressing that this did not amount to removal or suspension of Mr. Steinberg\u2019s position as managing editor, Mr. Steinberg agreed, but added that, if removed, he would \u201cmake a story out of it,\u201d thereby issuing another extortionate demand to the board.\u000aTo be clear: Mr. Steinberg\u2019s removal is related not to the content of his article, but to his disclosure of private board deliberations and his inappropriate demands of our board.\u000aWhile we stand behind Mr. Steinberg\u2019s right to express his opinions within our publication in his capacity as managing editor, we take umbrage with his carelessness and his calculated manipulation of our board.\u000aBecause it is clear that Mr. Steinberg does not have the best interests of this publication at heart, we promoted our opinion editor to his position and removed him from our staff.\u000aWe had hoped that Mr. Steinberg and our publication could split in an amicable fashion, but we have concluded that Mr. Steinberg wishes instead to defame our publication in service of his own personal ambition.\u000aFor this reason, we have reluctantly chosen to issue this statement in our defense.

aS'Student Wants to Tear Down German Composer Frieze'
p131
aVLast week, in an opinion article for The Student Life (TSL)\u2014the student-government funded newspaper of the Claremont Colleges\u2014a Pomona College student called for the removal of German composer Richard Wagner\u2019s frieze from Pomona\u2019s Bridges Auditorium, explicitly echoing recent calls to tear down Confederate statues.\u000a\u201cIn spite of renewed determination to combat anti-Semitism from members of both major political parties and organizations across the spectrum, the spotlight has yet to expose a principle anti-Semite memorialized on our very own campus: Richard Wagner, one of five composers whose name and likeness is etched onto Pomona College\u2019s Bridges Auditorium,\u201d the article states. \u000aThe article argues that \u201che [Wagner] diffused his prejudice not only through his inclusion of anti-Semitic tropes and characters in his operas, but also through articles such as \u2018Das Judenthum in der Musik\u2019 or \u2018Jewishness in Music.\u2019\u201d\u000aQuestioning the decision of putting Wagner\u2019s frieze up in the first place, the article asserts that \u201cit [Wagner\u2019s frieze] is a relic of the era in which the building was constructed: a time when there were quotas on Jewish enrollment in higher education, or when Jews were barred from attending universities altogether.\u201d\u000a\u201cHigher education\u2019s past injustices toward Jews makes it all the more crucial that we clearly acknowledge that Richard Wagner is the Robert E. Lee of our campus,\u201d asserts the student.\u000aTying the fate of the frieze to the recent movement to tear down Confederate statues across the country, the article states that \u201c[t]he glorification of Lee and Wagner is unacceptable and their hateful ideologies deserve to be expunged from existence. As Robert E. Lee must be torn down from his podium in Charlottesville, so too must Wagner be removed from his lofty perch on Pomona\u2019s most prized structure\u2026\u201d\u000aWhile the article\u2019s author does admit Wagner\u2019s musical brilliance, he believes that brilliance does not grant Wagner \u201cunadulterated\u201d commemoration:\u000a\u201c[Wagner] was, unquestionably, a very gifted composer\u2026.marveling at Wagner\u2019s musical talent does not forgive his vile attitude toward Jews. Nor does it grant him the right to unadulterated celebration, either in concert or as ornamentation.\u201d\u000aFor further insight into this matter, the Independent contacted Professor Eric Lindholm, conductor of the Pomona College Orchestra and professor of music, for comment on the controversy surrounding Wagner and musicians\u2019\u2014including the Pomona College Orchestra\u2019s\u2014stances on performing Wagner.\u000aAccording to Professor Lindholm, \u201c[t]he decision of whether to perform Wagner is a tricky one. It is not just that he was virulently anti-Semitic, but that so much of his entire artistic philosophy was based on an intense German nationalism that included anti-Semitism as a key ingredient.\u201d\u000a\u201cIt is not possible to separate Wagner\u2019s music from his broader cultural views. Some musicians refuse to perform Wagner, but we also have someone like James Levine, who is Jewish and one of the greatest Wagner conductors of all time. Each artist needs to come to terms on their own with how they handle Wagner.\u201d\u000a\u201cIn the classroom, Wagner cannot be ignored.  Most scholars would agree that he and Beethoven are the two most important composers of the nineteenth century,\u201d adding that \u201c[Wagner\u2019s] influences\u2026are seen in the work of countless other artists. But studying Wagner does not mean endorsing his views, any more than studying racism or sexism as cultural phenomena means endorsing those perspectives.\u201d\u000aAs for the Pomona College Orchestra\u2019s performances of Wagner, Professor Lindholm stated that \u201c[the orchestra] performed Wagner on only two programs during my 22-plus years here.  Both times, I alerted the members of the orchestra to the problems with Wagner and invited them to opt out if they would find the experience too objectionable, but no one has.\u201d The Pomona College Orchestra has not played a piece by Wagner since the 2013-2014 academic year.\u000aOn the frieze itself, Lindholm noted that \u201cit could stand to be updated. The five composers featured were all dead before the College was even founded. Given the range of performances that take place in Big Bridges, not to mention elsewhere on campus, there is no reason to present it as being primarily for Western art music.\u201d\u000aThe opinion article concludes by advising the country to be \u201cvigilant\u201d of anti-semitism across the world.\u000a\u201cIt is now, in a time of increased anti-Semitic incidents, not just in the United States, but also worldwide, particularly on college campuses, that we must remain vigilant of everyday occurrences of prevailing anti-Semitism. Although students on campus may not be aware of the painful history Wagner evokes, I shudder to perform in Bridges Auditorium\u2026\u201d\u000aIn a statement to the Independent, a Pomona College spokesperson said the college is \u201cnot aware of any previous requests\u201d to tear down Wagner\u2019s frieze and that they \u201cdo not have an estimate\u201d of how much removing the frieze might cost.\u000aBridges Auditorium was designed by architect William Templeton Johnson and built in 1931. The architect drew inspiration for the auditorium from \u201cNorthern Italian Renaissance architecture.\u201d It is considered to be one of the finest halls as well as one of the most photographed buildings in all of Southern California.\u000aPomona College is an elite liberal arts school in Southern California and founding member of the Claremont Consortium, which includes five undergraduate colleges and two graduate institutions.\u000aShare this:Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)MoreClick to print (Opens in new window)Click to share on Pinterest (Opens in new window)Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)Click to share on Google+ (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Tags: monuments Robert E.

aS'Pomona Refuses to Punish Students for Illicit Blockade of Conservative Speaker'
p143
aVIn an email sent this evening, Pomona College administrators characterized policy violations by Pomona students who blockaded the appearance of conservative speaker Heather Mac Donald at neighboring Claremont McKenna College (CMC) as \u201cminor\u201d and said that they would issue no sanctions for the students\u2019 conduct, claiming falsely that \u201cthere was no evidence that participants were instructed to disperse\u201d by campus authorities.\u000aDeclaring that the college had conducted \u201ca comprehensive review of photos and videos sent by CMC,\u201d the email, signed by Pomona deans Ric Townes and Christopher Waugh, acknowledged that \u201cPomona students were present and did block access to buildings\u201d in violation of college policy, but stopped short of issuing any sanctions for their conduct.\u000aThe deans justified the college\u2019s inaction with a number of claims, including that \u201cthere was no evidence that participants were instructed to disperse\u201d and that \u201cthere was no indication of property damage or physical altercations.\u201d\u000aIn such situations, the deans said, \u201cPomona College\u2019s approach has been to engage in conversations with students, reminding them of the policy,\u201d rather than giving the policy any force.\u000aThe deans neglected to address CMC\u2019s findings that the blockading students \u201cbreached institutional values of freedom of expression and assembly\u201d and \u201cviolated policies \u2026 that prohibit material disruption of college programs and created unsafe conditions in disregard of state law.\u201d\u000aAdditionally, at least one of the deans\u2019 claims\u2014that there was \u201cno evidence\u201d that campus authorities instructed student protesters to disperse\u2014is directly contradicted by the findings of Claremont McKenna\u2019s investigation and independent eyewitness accounts.\u000aIn a July statement discussing the protests, CMC announced that its investigation had revealed that \u201cthree Campus Safety Officers moved toward the [blockading] Group to advise them to stop [dismantling security fencing].\u201d\u000aAccording to the same statement, later on, as campus security \u201cretreated \u2026 to establish a secondary security boundary,\u201d students \u201cpaused their movement in acknowledgement of that boundary for almost two minutes\u201d before pressing through the officers to establish their illicit blockade.\u000aPomona\u2019s statement also asserts that \u201cthere was no indication of property damage or physical altercations.\u201d A video of the protests taken by an Independent staffer, however, shows the staffer being accosted, and other students and journalists were subjected to threats and physical intimidation from the mob of protesters.\u000aAsked by the Independent whether he would clarify the basis for the Pomona administrators\u2019 apparently false claim, a Pomona College spokesperson has yet to respond.\u000aThe Pomona deans\u2019 email is the first public acknowledgement by campus officials of an investigation into the conduct of Pomona students at the April protest at CMC, which, along with Pomona and three other undergraduate colleges, is part of the Claremont Colleges consortium and occupies the same Claremont, California campus.\u000aThe April protest, which ended with Claremont police officers rushing the speaker into an unmarked police vehicle to escape the student mob, ignited a firestorm of controversy across the country as well as on campus.\u000aUnder heavy pressure to defend CMC\u2019s commitment to freedom of speech on campus\u2014a commitment already bruised after he capitulated to student protesters and facilitated the highly visible resignation of a college dean in November 2015\u2014CMC President Hiram Chodosh responded quickly to the April protest, launching an investigation that resulted in multi-semester suspensions for a number of students by summer\u2019s end.\u000aThis swift justice was unique among the Claremont Colleges. Despite being the source of most of the protesters at Mac Donald\u2019s talk, none of the other colleges has issued sanctions to its students for blockading her speech and compromising the physical safety of those trapped inside the venue.\u000aIn a statement to the Independent in June, Pitzer College, another member of the Claremont Colleges consortium, said that it was not even in correspondence with CMC regarding any student code violations. At this point, Claremont McKenna had already completed its investigation and had scheduled disciplinary hearings.\u000aAsked about the deans\u2019 email, several Pomona students expressed strong disagreement with the college\u2019s decision to impose no sanctions on its policy violators.\u000aOne of these students, Matthew Ludlam, a sophomore at Pomona, told the Independent in a message that \u201cwhen Pomona doesn\u2019t punish the protesters they tell Claremont McKenna that they [Pomona] endorse their students actively disrupting [CMC\u2019s] campus activities.\u201d\u000aLudlam added that \u201cPomona students need to be punished if our school is to be taken seriously. What we [the students] did was wrong, and we should be held accountable for our actions.\u201d\u000a\u201cThe administration is being lazy and cowardly,\u201d said another Pomona student, who wished to remain anonymous. \u201cThis is going to affect relations between schools and how each holds both their own and other students accountable on its campus.\u201d\u000a\u201cThis is no doubt preemptive damage control,\u201d he continued, \u201cfor if Pomona\u2019s administration were to hold the college\u2019s students accountable, they would no doubt face backlash on their own campus that they don\u2019t want to be responsible for.\u201d\u000aBesides Pomona College and Claremont McKenna College, the Claremont Colleges consortium also includes Scripps College, Pitzer College, and Harvey Mudd College.

aS'Claremont College Administrators Respond to Trump DACA Decision'
p147
aVIn the wake of President Donald Trump\u2019s decision to end the DACA program, administrators at the Claremont Colleges\u2014a consortium of five elite undergraduate liberal arts institutions\u2014promised their full support and protection, including legal aid and emergency grant funds, to DACA students at the colleges.\u000aDACA, short for Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, allows certain young adults brought to the United States illegally as children to work and live in the U.S. without fear of deportation. The policy first began during the Obama administration, which, after failing to pass immigration reform through Congress, opted instead to provide quasi-legal status to certain young noncitizens through executive action.\u000aPresident Trump\u2019s decision, which paves the way for students who are DACA recipients to be deported as early as March 2018 if Congress fails to come up with a replacement plan, has faced scrutiny from both Democrat and Republican politicians, and is also now under fire from businessmen and college presidents, including those from the Claremont Colleges, which are home to many DACA recipients.\u000a\u201cI write to you with a heavy heart and great concern. Earlier this morning we learned that the [DACA] program has been rescinded and will wind down over the next six months,\u201d President Gabrielle Starr of Pomona College wrote in an email to the Pomona College community. \u000aPresident Starr also pointed out the support Pomona College will lend to its DACA students, including legal aid. \u000a\u201cPomona stands united with all DACA and undocumented students,\u201d she said. \u201cThese young people contribute greatly, not only to our campus and community, but to the entire nation\u2026the College is taking further steps to assist members of our community \u2026 including the availability of emergency legal assistance, which has been fully funded by philanthropy through the generosity of our Board of Trustees.\u201d\u000aPomona College Dean of Students Miriam Feldblum followed up on President Starr\u2019s statements, adding that \u201cthe College has retained a small group of lawyers who will be available to offer individual consultations.\u201d\u000aIn terms of financial support, work-study allotments will be replaced \u201cwith appropriate emergency grant aid,\u201d Dean Feldblum added. \u201cThe College will continue to provide emergency grant funding to students for immigration-related costs.\u201d\u000aAt Claremont McKenna College (CMC), Associate Dean of Students for Diversity, Inclusion & Residential Life Vince Greer similarly announced that \u201cin lieu of the official announcement today regarding The Trump\u2019s administration [sic] decision to rescind the DACA program we wanted to create a space for students to come together and process the ramification of this event.\u201d\u000aHe also said that CMC will host a DACA workshop, where \u201c[i]mmigration attorney Lauren Burke will discuss the implication of the President\u2019s decision.\u201d \u000aPitzer College\u2019s President Melvin Oliver responded to Trump\u2019s move, stating that \u201cPitzer College reaffirms its commitment to its\u2014and America\u2019s\u2014core values of social justice and intercultural understanding, and will continue to recognize the right of all DACA students to pursue the American Dream \u2026 We will not turn away from the commitments we have made to DACA students and other vulnerable immigrant students.\u201d\u000a\u201cThese students are quintessential representatives of Pitzer, embodying in their courageous actions and spirit our shared values. To our Dreamers, please know that we support you during this difficult period.\u201d\u000aStudents at the Claremont Colleges had similar sentiments. Matthew Ludlam (PO\u2019 20), said \u201c[removing DACA] seriously hurts those in our college community who spent their lives here, and while I think DACA provides security, if it were to be removed it would have to be phased out. That way existing occupants would remain covered.\u201d\u000a\u201cMost importantly it [removing DACA] provides no contingency for what should be common sense cases. What about college students who have spent their whole lives here, gone to school here, made friends here, who may not even speak fluent Spanish because they were so young when they came here,\u201d Ludlam added. \u201cYou\u2019re telling me they aren\u2019t American enough?\u201d\u000aThis story is developing.\u000aShare this:Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)MoreClick to print (Opens in new window)Click to share on Pinterest (Opens in new window)Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)Click to share on Google+ (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Categories: Campus News

aS'Pitzer Dean of Students Concealed Material Evidence in Title IX Investigation'
p151
aVIn her former job as a director of judicial affairs at the University of California, Santa Barbara, Pitzer College\u2019s newly hired dean of students Sandra Vasquez concealed material evidence from a low-income, minority student seeking to defend himself against a suspension levied by school officials in response to unfounded criminal allegations, according to a March 2017 court order and complaint submitted in July.\u000aAccording to the complaint, to which the Independent has obtained access, during a September 2016 hearing with the student, Vasquez concealed two pieces of material evidence that she and the college were considering in the course of their investigation, despite assuring the student that she had disclosed to him all of the information upon which she and the college would rely in determining whether to lift his suspension.\u000aIn relying upon this unmentioned evidence\u2014which, upon revelation, proved to be uncorroborated and allegedly completely fabricated\u2014to sustain the student\u2019s suspension, Vasquez and other college officials willfully denied the student the opportunity to respond to all the evidence against him.\u000aIn fact, the student would not learn about all of this purported evidence until March 2017\u2014months after Vasquez and the college had decided to maintain his suspension indefinitely.\u000aIn that March 2017 court order, Superior Court Judge Thomas Anderle enjoined the enforcement of UCSB\u2019s suspension order and commanded the college to give the student \u201cfull access to UCSB and all programs and activities \u2026 with no restrictions.\u201d He castigated Vasquez and other college officials for violating the student\u2019s due process rights and thereby dispensing with one of the most critical elements of any judicial proceeding.\u000a\u201cJohn Doe [the student] is entitled to know all the information against him at the hearing; not via emailing his counsel allegedly critical and decisive information at a later time,\u201d Anderle declared. \u201cThe fact is, that it is patently obvious to this Court, Petitioner was seriously prejudiced by the use of [this evidence].\u201d\u000a\u201cThe backbone of our legal system requires all evidence to be presented in the Courtroom where it can be tested; it can be questioned,\u201d he continued. \u201cEvidence acquired otherwise is an abrogation of our legal system.\u201d\u000aAnderle also blasted Vasquez and other officials for stretching the college\u2019s investigation into the student\u2019s already vindicated conduct over nearly three quarters of school\u2014more than 200 days, in blatant violation of the college\u2019s own statutory obligations\u2014in an effort to discourage him from attending at all.\u000a\u201cThis Court concludes that the University is intentionally doing indirectly what it is unwilling to do directly,\u201d Anderle wrote. \u201cThe University has made a decision to deny John Doe the opportunity to enroll \u2026 [b]ut instead of making that decision based upon the facts, the law, and in fairness, it has decided to do it their own way.\u201d\u000a\u201cThe University\u2019s inaction over such a lengthy period of time, leaving Petitioner in limbo, is unreasonable and arbitrary,\u201d he said. The length of the investigation violated not only federal guidance but also multiple U.C. statutes and regulations.\u000aThe judge spared no criticism of the interim suspension itself, which he characterized as \u201cparticularly egregious given the University\u2019s delay in completion of its Title IX investigation, the dismissal of the juvenile court proceedings against Petitioner, and the seven month interruption in his education.\u201d\u000aBecause the student suffered \u201cirreparable harm\u201d at the hands of Vasquez and other officials, the judge explained, the student merited full judicial relief.\u000aIn her new position at Pitzer College, Vasquez is \u201cresponsible for enforcement of the Code of Student Conduct and for ensuring that the rights of all students are upheld.\u201d\u000aShe is also a Title IX coordinator, tasked with, among other things, \u201censuring prompt and equitable resolution of complaints.\u201d\u000aThe Independent has also learned that the student\u2019s case has been accepted by the Department of Education for investigation on the basis of potential Title IX and Title VI violations. Title IX \u201cprohibits discrimination on the basis of sex,\u201d while Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 \u201cprohibits discrimination on the basis of race, color or national origin,\u201d according to the Department of Education\u2019s website.\u000aOn that investigation, the student\u2019s San Diego-based attorney, Bob Ottilie, stated, \u201cWhile the specifics of the Department of Education investigation are confidential, I can confirm that Ms. Vasquez\u2019s conduct is a component.\u201d\u000aVasquez and Pitzer College officials have yet to respond to the Independent\u2019s requests for comment.

aS'When A Photo With the VP Is \xe2\x80\x9cViolence\xe2\x80\x9d'
p155
aVMutual respect for those with right-leaning political beliefs is lost on liberal students at the Claremont Colleges.\u000aMost students probably come to that conclusion within their first week at Claremont. I certainly did after just a few days in Scripps\u2019s freshman seminar course, \u201cCore,\u201d a mandatory curriculum to introduce\u2014although \u201cindoctrinate\u201d more accurately describes my personal experience\u2014the theories and philosophies Scripps faculty deem necessary for students\u2019 college education (Angela Davis\u2019s Are Prisons Obsolete? was the class Bible).\u000aI did not feel that I could freely express my own views without being shunned by my classmates and professors alike. So, I did not. I kept my head down and did my best to avoid sparking controversy.\u000aA few weeks ago, however, I saw how personally my peers take politics upon sharing a photo of me standing with Vice-President Mike Pence and Republican Congresswoman Cathy McMorris Rodgers. Knowing my Facebook audience was politically diverse, I made no political comments. Instead, I shared my excitement and gratitude for the opportunity to intern for Rodgers\u2014the highest ranking Republican woman in Congress\u2014and to interact with such impactful and important people in my job.\u000aThe photo should not have caused any trouble. But my Scripps College and Claremont peers begged to differ.\u000aAccording to my peers, taking a photo with Vice-President Pence is anything but neutral. In fact, it constitutes direct violence and oppression against marginalized groups.\u000aShortly after posting the photo, I began receiving vicious comments and private messages accusing me of not caring about LGBTQ rights and attacking me for getting anywhere near the Vice-President. Close friends and distant acquaintances alike lashed out in fury, subjecting me to lectures, rants, and name-calling\u2014all while ignoring the photo\u2019s plainly apolitical context.\u000aOne person accused me of \u201cignoring the plights of marginalized people to achieve personal gain,\u201d saying I was a person who \u201csmiled with [their] oppressors.\u201d Some took to mockery, inquiring, \u201cDid you manage to ask him why he thinks women are second-class citizens?\u201d and \u201cHow many LBGTQ folks do you need to help send to conversion therapy in exchange for reproductive rights from Pence?\u201d. A friend asked me why I would stand next to someone who is \u201ca threat to human rights everywhere.\u201d A classmate simply commented, \u201cBitch.\u201d Many others \u201cliked\u201d these comments, endorsing this shameless harassment.\u000aHow did we get here?\u000aHow did we get to the point where taking a photo with someone is an act of violence? How will we ever be able to have adult conversations if no one is ever willing to listen to those who have opposing philosophies? How can we coexist when we write off our political opponents\u2014as well as those who dare to take photos with them\u2014as morally bankrupt?\u000aA mere \u201cI saw you got to meet the Vice-President; what was that like?\u201d to begin a friendly conversation would have been enough\u2014or simply saying nothing at all. But instead, my peers thought the best way to respond was to confront, accuse, and lecture.\u000aNo one seems to remember what their teachers have taught them since Kindergarten: Be respectful of others. Apparently, when it comes to those with whom they disagree, many of my peers are only capable of disrespectful engagement.\u000aFor them, there is no value in one of their classmates working for a member of Congress if that member is a Republican. They are horrified that someone in the Scripps community would take a photo with the current Vice-President, a man with whom they disagree.\u000aIt is as if every student must follow an understood uniform code of conduct and speech\u2014as if I must share the liberal politics of my peers in order to be treated with respect or considered a decent person. Their lecturing about diversity apparently does not extend to diversity of thought.\u000aThis is not as it should be. We need a genuine dialogue\u2014now more than ever.\u000aWhile division clearly exists between Republicans and Democrats serving within our government, many members of Congress recognize the importance of engaging with individuals across the aisle.\u000aA member of congressional leadership addressed me and my fellow congressional interns this summer with what he said was the most important piece of advice he has received in all his years in government: Be passionate about what you\u2019re passionate about. But, he said, it never serves you well to anger or alienate the other side. What does work is to treat your political opponents with respect and seek common ground with them at every opportunity.\u000aThe Claremont Colleges are full of passionate individuals. However, you will not persuade anyone by being the loudest to yell, or condemning others because their views do not align with yours. Instead, we should engage in civil discourse and allow respect and reason to prevail.

aS'ASPC Debuts Free Ride Shares For Marginalized Students Only'
p159
aVThe Associated Students of Pomona College (ASPC), the student government at the college, is funding and launching an airport rideshare program that will provide free transportation from two Los Angeles area airports to campus exclusively for students from \u201cnon-traditional\u201d family structures and immigrant, DACA/undocumented, first-generation, and low-income students.\u000aIn a form shared to the Pomona College Class of 2021 Facebook page, ASPC informs potential applicants on details of its pilot program, which it plans to implement on move-in weekend for incoming freshmen.\u000a\u201cThe Associated Students of Pomona College is launching our Airport Rideshare system by providing domestic* incoming first-year and transfer students free-of-charge transportation from LAX (Los Angeles International) and Ontario Airport to campus the evening before** and morning of move-in day,\u201d the form explains.\u000aASPC states that \u201cfor the launch of this program, we are prioritizing students from low-income, first-generation, DACA/undocumented, mixed (immigration) status family, and/or \u2018non-traditional\u2019 family structure backgrounds.\u201d Confirming the exclusive nature of the program, the form says that \u201cfuture airport rideshares will be open to all students,\u201d but in the meantime urges students not to question the present policy of exclusion.\u000a\u201cPlease respect this and your future classmates\u2019 needs and experiences,\u201d the form says.\u000aIt is unclear why students from immigrant backgrounds, including those in the EB-5 Immigrant Investment Program, or \u201cnon-traditional\u201d families, require special assistance in procuring transportation to campus from area airports. In its announcement of the program, ASPC did not provide details as to how it would determine which students seeking free rides do in fact belong to the specific groups it declared to be eligible for the service.\u000aSome students applauded the general direction of the program, but questioned why students from the non-low income groups listed, especially students from \u201cnon-traditional\u201d families, need assistance in transportation.\u000a\u201cThe order should be determined by need, as that is the most accurate standard of application for this [program],\u201d Matthew Ludlam (PO \u201920) said in a message to the Independent. \u201cThose groups they mention are going to be the most likely \u2018in need\u2019 \u2026 the only problem I have is with the third group [non-traditional families] \u2026 they [ASPC] just need better parameters.\u201d\u000aAnother Pomona student told the Independent that while the new ASPC program\u2019s exclusions have some merit, \u201cit doesn\u2019t make sense that these students are given priority\u201d given that ASPC has indicated it plans to expand the program to serve \u201call students\u201d in the future.\u000aThe form\u2019s stated requirements for eligibility make it clear that non-low income students on financial aid, such as those from middle-income families, would not qualify, but some students believe those students would not benefit from the rideshare program. In an anonymous message to the Independent, another sophomore asserted that \u201cstudents who come from middle-class families very often have the finances to get to and from campus without as much worry as students with fewer resources.\u201d \u000aBut according to Ludlam, the costs of moving into college are not a walk in the park for many non-low income students.\u000a\u201cIt isn\u2019t only difficult for low-income students\u2014the hidden costs of moving in can put a toll on the household degrading the quality of life not only for the student but also their parents or potential siblings. Colleges give us a quote for how much it will cost, but these quotes do not accurately portray many of the hidden costs involved with being a student.\u201d\u000aInternational students also do not qualify for the ASPC\u2019s ride sharing program at this time, since they \u201chave separate travel arrangements made by International Place,\u201d according to ASPC. International Place, the Claremont Colleges\u2019 international student center, provides a complimentary airport shuttle service to new incoming international students, though many of these students are ineligible for the service.\u000aASPC is funded through a mandatory $355 annual student body fee, paid by all students and assessed yearly.\u000aPomona College is a member of the Claremont University Consortium.

aS'Silencing Dissent Is Social Injustice'
p163
aVIn an editorial published Wednesday, the editorial board of The Student Life\u2014the Claremont Colleges\u2019 newspaper funded almost exclusively by mandatory student fees\u2014\u201cwholeheartedly disavow[ed] the sanctions Claremont McKenna College imposed\u201d on students who blockaded the entrances and exits to a scheduled appearance by conservative scholar Heather Mac Donald at the college in April.\u000aThe board rests its case against the sanctions on a black-and-white portrait of moral rectitude. While the protesters are fearless warriors for social justice forcing the college onto \u201cthe long path towards equity,\u201d CMC plays the role of the evil conservative campus scrambling to preserve its antiquated and morally bankrupt institutions.\u000aBy punishing the protesters for their heroic act of aggression in the face of Mac Donald\u2019s objectionable views, TSL believes, CMC shirked its duty to advance justice: in this case, apparently, the muzzling of Heather Mac Donald.\u000aBut this definition of social justice, which would empower any sufficiently motivated group of students to shutter the speech and assembly privileges of others, contravenes the very purpose of higher education and, ironically enough, would provide a sufficient basis for suppressing the speech that TSL would prefer to see pervade the campus debate.\u000aImagine that it hadn\u2019t been Heather Mac Donald speaking at the Athenaeum. Imagine instead that it had been you, and a group of students, convinced of your depravity, blockaded the doors and shoved away attendees in order to silence your dangerous words. Granted the freedom to silence on the basis of their moral outrage, your critics would have all the justification they could possibly need to muzzle you and deny you your audience\u2014regardless of the content of your address.

aS'Students Seek Apology, Explanations for QRC Director\xe2\x80\x99s Ouster'
p167
aVIn an open letter released this evening\u2014the second this week on the matter\u2014a group of students at the Claremont Colleges have demanded that the Pomona College administration apologize for removing Dr. Jonathan Higgins from his position as director of the Queer Resource Center (QRC).\u000aThe students, who identified themselves as the \u201cConcerned QTPOC [Queer Trans People of Color] and Accomplices of the Claremont Colleges,\u201d urged the college to issue a \u201cformal apology to Dr. Higgins and statement of the wrong that has been done\u201d with Higgins\u2019s termination, as well as to clarify the college\u2019s stance on \u201cwhat constitutes a fireable offense with regards to social media posts.\u201d\u000aThe college announced Higgins\u2019s removal last week after several controversial statements from his public Twitter account, including a tweet in which he expressed his wariness of \u201cwhite gays and well meaning white women,\u201d surfaced in national media coverage.\u000aIn the latest open letter, simmering frustration with the rapidity of Pomona\u2019s decision\u2014and with the lack of input from students or the other Claremont Colleges\u2014is evident. The students say that they want \u201can explanation of why a decision that affects a 5C [Claremont Consortium] resource was made seemingly unilaterally, with the involvement of only Pomona staff\u201d and without the involvement of \u201cany of the QRC staff or any queer students on campus.\u201d\u000aThe letter also seeks a \u201cdescription of the process for hiring Dr. Higgins\u2019 replacement, with particular focus on safeguards and steps to ensure that the hiring process selects someone who will be an ally to and advocate for queer students of color,\u201d and urges the college to take steps \u201cto ensure this type of hiring debacle does not occur again.\u201d\u000aAdditionally, the students claim that queer trans people of color see the QRC \u201cas an unwelcoming space\u201d and that the QRC is underfunded and understaffed. These issues, the students say, \u201cmerit action\u201d by the college.\u000a\u201c[W]e do believe that the events described above,\u201d the students write, \u201care serious and merit action and work so that Claremont can be a positive community for queer students of color.\u201d\u000aUnlike last week\u2019s letter from the \u201cOutraged Student Affairs Professionals,\u201d an amalgamation of staff members from colleges across the country which demanded the firing of a college dean for her role in Higgins\u2019s firing, the latest letter concludes that more information is \u201cnecessary to pin blame on any particular administrator,\u201d and the majority of signatories of the new letter hail from the Claremont Colleges.\u000aThe Claremont Colleges is a consortium of five elite undergraduate liberal arts colleges which includes Pomona College, Claremont McKenna College, Harvey Mudd College, Scripps College, and Pitzer College. The Claremont Colleges share a Queer Resource Center.\u000aThis is a developing story and will be updated accordingly.

aS'CMC Suspends Multiple Students for Policy Violations at April Protest'
p171
aVIn a statement this morning, Claremont McKenna College announced sanctions placed on ten CMC students for violating college policy during the protests against Heather Mac Donald that took place in early April.\u000aOf the approximately 170 protesters who \u201cbreached the perimeter safety and security fence\u201d and blocked entrances and exits of the Marian Miner Cook Athenaeum during the protests, twelve were identified as CMC students eligible for punishment by the college, and of those, ten received sanctions including suspensions and probations.\u000aAnother four non-CMC students have had their on-campus privileges limited for their \u201csignificant roles in the blockade.\u201d\u000aThe announcement marks the conclusion of CMC\u2019s investigation into the protests, which has been ongoing since at least May. The college undertook \u201ca review of available video and photographic evidence\u201d to identify the students involved in policy violations in the course of the protests. Ultimately, the college charged ten students with violations of college policy, only to find that three of those students \u201cwere not responsible for any violation.\u201d\u000a\u201cAfter a full conduct investigation and review process for the remaining seven students, an independent community panel found each student responsible for policy violations,\u201d the college said. \u201cThree students received one-year suspensions \u2026 Two received one-semester suspensions \u2026 Two were put on conduct probation.\u201d\u000aThe college added that \u201call sanctions include strong educational components.\u201d\u000aThese sanctions come three months after students from across the Claremont Colleges\u2014a consortium of five liberal arts colleges which includes CMC\u2014protested a talk by Mac Donald, a vocal critic of the Black Lives Matter movement. After labeling Mac Donald\u2014a Stanford University-educated attorney and conservative political commentator\u2014an \u201canti-Black fascist,\u201d the protesters organized a blockade of the Athenaeum to deny her an in-person audience, prompting CMC President Hiram Chodosh to vow to bring to justice the students who violated policy during the protests.\u000aIn its latest statement, the college described the specific transgressions of the protesters, who \u201cbreached the perimeter safety and security fence and campus safety line, and established human barriers to entrances and exits,\u201d thereby \u201cdepriv[ing] many of the opportunity to gather, hear the speaker, and engage with questions and comments.\u201d \u000a\u201cThe blockade breached institutional values of freedom of expression and assembly,\u201d the college stated. \u201cFurthermore, this action violated policies of both the College and The Claremont Colleges that prohibit material disruption of college programs and created unsafe conditions in disregard of state law,\u201d the statement continued, referring to the illegal blockade of fire exits. \u000aThe college completed \u201ca full, fair, and impartial student conduct process before determining the findings, sanctions, and the resolutions of appeals,\u201d the College declared.\u000aCMC also said that it has sent information regarding policy violations by students from the other Claremont Colleges to their respective schools.\u000a\u201cCMC has also provided evidence of policy violations by students of the other Claremont Colleges to their respective deans of students.\u201d Accordingly, in a letter released to the student body, \u201cconsistent with inter-college policy, CMC has asked each campus to review this evidence under their own conduct processes. In addition, CMC has issued provisional suspensions of on-campus privileges to four non-CMC students who appear to have played significant roles in the blockade.\u201d\u000aIn a statement to the Independent last month, however, Pitzer College claimed that it was not in correspondence with Claremont McKenna regarding any student code violations. Administrators at Pitzer have not yet responded to further requests for comment on this matter.

aS'College Saw Controversial Tweets Before Hiring QRC Director'
p175
aVPomona College Dean of Students Miriam Feldblum released an email statement this morning affirming that the college was aware of former Claremont Colleges\u2019 Queer Resource Center (QRC) Dr. Jonathan Higgins\u2019 controversial tweets prior to his hiring. The news raises new questions over the extent to which recent media coverage of Dr. Higgins\u2019s questionable comments about white gays, women, and the police influenced the college\u2019s decision to terminate him within 48 hours of his first day on the job.\u000aDr. Higgins\u2019 tweets, which came to national attention last week, included comments on how \u201cpolice are meant to serve and protect white supremacy\u201d and expressed a wariness of \u201cwhite gays and well meaning white women.\u201d In other tweets, Higgins characterized heterosexuality as \u201ccelebrat[ing] rape culture, homophobia and transphobia\u2026every day.\u201d The tweets were published and fully public well before Higgins\u2019 hiring in June.\u000aThis morning, only a few days following Higgins\u2019 ouster, Dean Feldblum sent an email to all students at Pomona acknowledging that Higgins\u2019 tweets were known to the college during the hiring process.\u000a\u201cThe College was aware of Dr. Higgins\u2019 tweets and social media presence prior to our offer to hire him in early June,\u201d she wrote in the email. \u201cWe recognize that he brings an important voice to support of LGBTQIA students, and especially QTPOC [Queer Trans People of Color] students, and that he approaches his work with passion and concern.\u201d\u000aFeldblum also said that she and another dean had discussed with Higgins his social media presence and \u201cthe broader responsibilities of the Director position,\u201d among which is the responsibility to \u201ccreate an inclusive environment that honors the intersectionality and multiplicity of all student identities.\u201d\u000aThese conversations and the college\u2019s apparent knowledge of Higgins\u2019 social media outbursts apparently did little to compromise his candidacy for the directorship. A dean of students announced his hiring in an email sent in June, praising his work as \u201ca motivational speaker dedicated to empowering all LGBTQ students with an emphasis on students of color.\u201d\u000aYet within 48 hours of Higgins\u2019 start as QRC director, the college chose to terminate him\u2014only hours after the tweets they had reviewed at length with their new hire came to light in national media coverage.\u000aNeither Feldblum nor other representatives of the college have shed much light on the reasons for their sudden reversal\u2014or why it occurred only after Higgins had officially entered his new role.\u000a\u201cBoth prior to and after his hire, Dean Jan [Collins-Eaglin] (and later Dean Jan and I) also engaged in thoughtful discussions with Jonathan about social media and the broader responsibilities of the Director position,\u201d Feldblum explained in her email this morning. \u201cHowever, as the discussions progressed, it became clear that our visions to ensure the support of all LGBTQIA students at The Claremont Colleges did not match, and that we could not reconcile our paths.\u201d\u000a\u201cThese decisions were made by Dean Jan and me,\u201d Feldblum continued, referring to Dr. Higgins\u2019 dismissal. \u201cThe QRC staff were not responsible for the decisions.\u201d \u000aFeldblum email statement\u2019s makes no mention of whether media coverage of Dr. Higgins\u2019 tweets contributed to his dismissal.\u000aFollowing Higgins\u2019 firing, an open letter published by a group of \u201coutraged student affairs professionals\u201d\u2014allegedly comprised of student affairs staff from colleges across the country\u2014criticized Pomona\u2019s decision to remove Higgins as \u201cgatekeeping that keeps Black queer professionals out of key positions to create change in higher education.\u201d The group also demanded Dean Feldblum\u2019s resignation for her \u201cgross missteps of both firing Dr. Higgins and continuously refusing to support marginalized students.\u201d\u000aResponding to these accusations in an email to the Independent, Dean Feldblum contended that she has dedicated her work to supporting all students, especially marginalized and underrepresented students.\u000a\u201cI have dedicated my work to supporting students, with particular attention to marginalized and underrepresented students, and am deeply committed to supporting my staff and their work,\u201d Feldblum said. \u201cI think these are substantive, important conversations, and I am happy to engage, listen, learn and share.\u201d

Higgins had only started work that week, just as his controversial tweets began emerging in news reports.\u000a\u201cI am writing today to let you know that we have reopened the national search for the Director of the Queer Resource Center,\u201d wrote Jan Collins-Eaglin, a Pomona College dean, making no direct reference to Dr. Higgins or to the media firestorm surrounding his comments. \u201cOur priorities for the QRC remain the same \u2013 to maintain in a seamless fashion the robust services of the Center, including its ability to provide direct support to students, expertise in workshops and trainings, and an inclusive space focused on student success and support, with a demonstrated commitment to diversity and community.\u201d\u000aThis message, however, evidently has disappointed a group of self-described \u201cStudent Affairs Professionals.\u201d Consisting of more than 100 student affairs employees and college students, the vast majority of whom hailing from colleges unaffiliated with the Claremont Colleges, this group has defended Higgins\u2019s comments and decried his dismissal as a \u201cgross injustice\u201d and an \u201cact of violence and silencing of queer black voices\u201d in an open letter to Dean Collins-Eaglin and Dean Miriam Feldblum, another Pomona College dean of students.\u000aTurning first to Higgins\u2019s controversial tweets, the group insists that his wariness of \u201cwhite gays and well meaning white women\u201d is fully warranted:\u000a\u201cIf history has taught us anything, we know that Dr. Higgins\u2019 experiences and caution are valid. White gay men have become the primary enactors of violence toward queer people of color. Recently in Philadelphia, white gay men were angered because the city introduced a new pride flag with added black and brown stripes. The colors, according to the Philadelphia Office of LGBT Affairs\u2019 More Color More Pride campaign, represent inclusion of people of color in the LGBTQ community. Dr. Mamta Motwani Accapadi  has written about and presented on the ways white women have enacted violence on people of color and served to perpetuate and benefit from white supremacy.\u201d \u000aThe letter further claims that terminating Higgins compromises inclusivity and constitutes an effort to prevent Black queer professionals from holding positions of power and challenging white supremacy.\u000a\u201cWe would like to state in no uncertain terms that the firing of Dr. Higgins is a gross injustice and serves as an act of violence and silencing of queer black voices,\u201d the group writes. \u201cThe firing of Dr. Higgins sets a dangerous precedent for the field of student affairs\u2014that those who directly and unapologetically challenge white supremacy, white fragility, and the multitude of problematic aspects of higher education and the dominant culture, will simply be discarded in favor of someone who will perpetrate the status quo. We refuse to sit idly by as Dr. Higgins, and by extension, countless black and brown queer and trans students, faculty, and staff, is denied his humanity and publicly shamed.\u201d\u000aThe group then issues five demands. In addition to demanding the resignation of Dean Feldblum for her role in Higgins\u2019s firing, it insists that the college develop \u201ca carefully thought out plan for addressing White fragility and White supremacy in the Claremont Colleges.\u201d A direct quote of the full list of demands is below:

aS'After Tweet Controversy, Dean Launches Search for New QRC Director'
p183
aVOnly a day after the College Fix uncovered tweets from the newly-appointed director of the Claremont Colleges\u2019 LGBTQ center announcing his wariness \u201cof white gays and well meaning white women\u201d and accusing police officers of \u201cservic[ing] and protect[ing] white supremacy,\u201d a dean at Pomona College announced that the college plans to launch a search for a new director.\u000aBack in June, the college first announced the appointment of Dr. Jonathan Higgins, the subject of the present controversy, as the new director of the Queer Resource Center of the Claremont Colleges. At the time, a dean highlighted his experience as a \u201cmotivational speaker dedicated to empowering all LGBTQ students with an emphasis on students of color.\u201d\u000aBut as early as last year, Higgins had been posting a number of controversial tweets on his public Twitter account. In December 2016, he wrote that \u201cpolice are meant to service and protect white supremacy.\u201d Asked in April to identify whom he is \u201cautomatically wary of/keep at a distance because of [his] past experiences,\u201d Higgins answered: \u201cWhite gays and well meaning white women.\u201d\u000aFollowing coverage from the College Fix and the Claremont Independent on his controversial statements, Dean Jan Collins-Eaglin, the Pomona College dean who had originally shared the news of Dr. Higgins\u2019s appointment, announced that the college would be seeking a new QRC director in an email sent to all students on Saturday afternoon. The body of this email is quoted below:\u000a\u201cI am writing today to let you know that we have reopened the national search for the Director of the Queer Resource Center. Our priorities for the QRC remain the same \u2013 to maintain in a seamless fashion the robust services of the Center, including its ability to provide direct support to students, expertise in workshops and trainings, and an inclusive space focused on student success and support, with a demonstrated commitment to diversity and community.\u000aThe new search will begin as soon as possible and constituents from across the colleges will participate in the search process.\u000aIn the next few weeks we will work to appoint interim leadership to lead the QRC, support the staff, and help support our student community while the national search is underway.  Al Forbes, who was recently appointed as Assistant Director of the QRC, will continue in that role, and I will be working closely to assist him during this period.  In addition, Student Dean\u2019s offices across The Claremont Colleges are committed to supporting the QRC, its student staff, and the broader LGBTQIA community during this upcoming period.\u000aSupporting students is our first priority. We will work with purpose and as quickly as possible to meet the important needs of our community.\u201d\u000aShare this:Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)MoreClick to print (Opens in new window)Click to share on Pinterest (Opens in new window)Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)Click to share on Google+ (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Categories: Campus News

p187
aVThe new director of the Claremont Colleges\u2019 LGBTQ center has drawn concern from some students upset over his tweets saying he\u2019s \u201cwary of white gays and well meaning white women\u201d and that police exist to \u201cservice and protect white supremacy,\u201d among other controversial statements.\u000aDr. Jonathan Higgins was recently tapped as the new director of the Queer Resource Center of the Claremont Colleges, a cluster of five elite private campuses in Los Angeles County.\u000aAfter several of Higgins\u2019 controversial tweets made the rounds among students at the consortium, several LGBTQ-identifying Claremont Colleges students spoke with The College Fix on the condition of anonymity to describe their unease with the new director.\u000aAt issue is his public Twitter account, which he actively promotes on his professional website. The students said they are concerned his apparently anti-white, anti-police views will carry over into misguided teachings and unequal treatment at the Queer Resource Center.\u000aHiggins has yet to address requests for comment from The College Fix about the concerns.\u000aOne tweet prompting unease is from April, made in response to a user who asked: \u201cWho are you automatically wary of/keep at a distance because of your past experiences?\u201d Higgins replied: \u201cWhite gays and well meaning white women.\u201d\u000aOne white, gay student told The Fix they feel they would not receive equal treatment under Higgins\u2019 oversight.\u000aAnother tweet drawing apprehension from some students is from December 2016, in which Higgins wrote: \u201cI finally have nothing to say other than police are meant to service and protect white supremacy.\u201d This post came on the same day as an officer-involved shooting in Maryland, though Higgins has yet to clarify whether there is a connection between this event and his post.\u000aAnother gay student at the Claremont Colleges said the tweet concerned him \u201cbecause my family is heavily involved in law enforcement and because I have many siblings and cousins, all of whom I support and love deeply, who serve as officers.\u201d\u000a\u201cMy family will only ever be seen as enforcers of white supremacy in Higgins\u2019 eyes with myself as an enabler,\u201d the student continued.\u000aA third tweet of Higgins\u2019 prompting concern was posted in late June: \u201cSo y\u2019all been real quiet about #heterosexualprideday, I mean I thought I\u2019d see parades celebrating rape culture, homophobia and transphobia,\u201d it stated. Higgins added: \u201cOh wait: y\u2019all do that everyday\u2026..\u201d\u000aA transgender student, speaking with The College Fix, said reading that was difficult.\u000a\u201cOnly through a long, difficult journey have I arrived at the conclusion that I am heterosexual,\u201d he said. \u201cMuch of the success of this powerful journey comes as a result of my wonderful mentors who are open-minded to every possibility. Based on his statements on social media, it is clear that Dr. Higgins associates heterosexuality with only negative causes and that he thinks to be openly proud of one\u2019s heterosexuality, as I am, is to \u2018celebrate rape culture, homophobia and transphobia \u2026 everyday.\u2019 His statements demean my efforts and are uncharacteristic of both my experiences with the QRC and the center\u2019s own mission statement.\u201d\u000aJan Collins-Eaglin, the associate dean of students for wellness and disability coordinator at Pomona College, who announced the center\u2019s hiring to the Claremont community, wrote Higgins \u201cis a motivational speaker dedicated to empowering all LGBTQ students with an emphasis on students of color.\u201d\u000aHiggins studied communication studies at California State University, San Bernardino with a minor in Women\u2019s Studies, and received a master\u2019s degree in management from the University of Redlands. He graduated in 2015 from an Ed.D. program in higher educational justice with a focus in higher education administration from the University of Redlands.\u000aProfessionally, before arriving at the Queer Resource Center of the Claremont Colleges, he served as the assistant director of multicultural affairs at California State University, Long Beach.\u000aAccording his personal website, where links to his social media profiles appear, \u201cDoctor Jon Paul\u201d once gave a \u201cTEDx\u201d talk at Cal State Long Beach titled \u201cUnderstanding Fear, Embracing Personal Power.\u201d Additionally, Higgins has been named a \u201cTop 100 LGBTQ Emerging Leader\u201d by the National Black Justice Coalition.

aS'CMC May Expel Student Policy Violators'
p191
aVSix students from Claremont McKenna College may face expulsion for violating the student code during an April protest of the appearance of conservative scholar Heather Mac Donald, the students\u2019 lawyer said in a statement before local media this week.\u000aThe public appearance by the attorney, who represents the students on behalf of Justice Warriors 4 Black Lives, a policy and legal network dedicated to supporting \u201ccurrent Black Liberation Movements,\u201d marks the first major news about the investigation since CMC\u2019s faculty voted in May to permit seniors who were under investigation to receive conditional degrees, despite the ongoing disciplinary proceedings.\u000aThe college told the Independent that the proceedings for the students in question are likely to conclude \u201cby the end of June.\u201d As far as the nature of the penalties the students might face, the college simply said that \u201cany students who are found responsible for violations of College policy will be assigned sanctions appropriate to the severity of the violation.\u201d\u000aIn a phone conversation with the Inland Valley Daily Bulletin, the students\u2019 lawyer painted her clients as the real victims. After pointing out that the students belong to various marginalized groups\u2014among them students of color, women, and LGBTQ students\u2014she accused the college of refusing to meet with her clients prior to the upcoming hearings, though she admitted subsequently that the students have already had several opportunities to make their case and plead for leniency before college officials.\u000a\u201cThe students are making an appeal inside and outside of the disciplinary hearings,\u201d she said by phone Monday to the Bulletin. \u201cLet\u2019s get into a dialogue. Why put degrees on the line to take punitive disciplinary process?\u201d\u000aIn its statement, the college emphasized that its conduct review process provides ample due process to students facing possible sanctions, including opportunities to appeal following the dispensation of final disciplinary judgments. \u201cThe College is currently conducting a full, fair, and impartial conduct investigation and review process with individual CMC students, which will conclude with a determination of findings, sanctions if warranted, and appeals.\u201d\u000aIn a Facebook Live press conference, Justice Warriors 4 Black Lives emphasized the \u201cpeaceful\u201d nature of the April protest, which they described as an expression of \u201cfree speech.\u201d And to the extent that college policy was violated, the group explained, it was an act of self-defense, brought about by the speaker herself. It was Heather Mac Donald, as a vocal opponent of Black Lives Matter and an advocate of stronger policing in high-crime communities, who \u201cmade students concerned for their safety and led to the campus protests,\u201d said Povi-Tamu Bryant, a spokeswoman for Justice Warriors 4 Black Lives.\u000aNeither the press conference nor the students\u2019 assemblage of legal counsel appears to have fazed college officials, who reiterated the college\u2019s commitment to taking appropriate action against those who violated policy during the protests, during which the surging crowd, mostly comprised of non-CMC students, blocked all entrances and exits\u2014including emergency exits\u2014to the venue where Mac Donald was scheduled to speak and forcibly blocked fellow students and even faculty from entering the building to attend the event.\u000a\u201cStudents who participated in the disruptive demonstration on April 6, 2017, were provided several overt cues that their behavior was in violation of policy,\u201d the college told the Independent.  \u201cStudents physically took apart barrier fencing that was set up to allow for protestors to exercise their free speech rights while also allowing for entrance into the event.  In addition, students disregarded Campus Safety Officers who were positioned to allow guests\u2019 entry into the event.\u201d\u000aThe college also emphasized that its \u201cdecision to exercise restraint by not using law enforcement to physically remove or arrest the people barricading the building did not signify any endorsement or approval of the tactics used that day to deny entry to the building and the attempted shut down of the presentation that was scheduled to take place in that building.\u201d\u000aIf the disciplinary hearings next week yield sanctions, Claremont McKenna would be the first of the five Claremont Colleges to take any kind of disciplinary action against its students for violating campus policy at the April protest.\u000aAsked whether it planned to investigate Pomona students who broke college rules at the protest, Pomona College confirmed to the Independent that it had \u201cbeen in communication with Claremont McKenna,\u201d but refused to comment any further about the subject of those communications or whether any disciplinary action against Pomona students might take place.\u000a\u201cWe do not have any control over the processes at the other Claremont Colleges,\u201d a Scripps College representative told the Independent, \u201cbut any request that a Scripps student undergo our disciplinary process would be evaluated, pursuant to our commitment to a fair and impartial process.\u201d\u000aPitzer College, meanwhile, demurred. \u201cThe College has not received a report [from CMC],\u201d said a college spokesperson in an email. \u201cIf we do, Pitzer will comply with our policies.\u201d\u000aAsked whether it is Pitzer\u2019s policy not to investigate the misconduct of its own students unless another college urges or demands that it do so, the same spokesperson did not respond.\u000aShare this:Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)MoreClick to print (Opens in new window)Click to share on Pinterest (Opens in new window)Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)Click to share on Google+ (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Categories: Campus News

aS'Why College Liberals Should Love Ronald Reagan'
p199
aVOn liberal college campuses, Ronald Reagan is seen as someone who bullied women, the poor, minorities, and the LGBT community. Reagan, however, was no cold-hearted oppressor. His policies actually benefited marginalized groups, but this fact is often overshadowed by stubborn attempts to dress him up as an iconic white cis hetero male oppressor. I will debunk four of the biggest myths here.\u000aMYTH: Ronald Reagan hurt the poor to benefit his rich cronies.\u000aRonald Reagan is perhaps best known and portrayed on college campuses as a fiscal conservative representing the interests of the rich and robbing the poor of opportunity\u2014a reverse Robin Hood. Putting aside his growth-focused fiscal policies, which helped all classes of Americans, Reagan helped the poor in particular through his drastic expansion of the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC). Reagan believed in lower taxes for all, and as such, made sure that the poor also had their tax rates lowered.\u000aReagan expanded the EITC in a way that allowed many low-income Americans to pay negative income taxes. In practice, this means that the most impoverished would receive a wealth transfer from the government rather than paying taxes. The EITC was targeted at low-income households with children, and, taking into account that children in complete families perform better academically and socially, sought to encourage families\u2014the social building blocks of America\u2014to stay together, paving the way for a better life for the next generation of American youth. Reagan\u2019s EITC expansion is a mere footnote in most history textbooks and online articles, but it illustrates that Reagan was not the cold-hearted, anti-poor capitalist that many liberals portray.\u000aVerdict: Reagan gave the poor a tax cut and protected low-income family units with the EITC.\u000aMYTH: Reagan was a racist.\u000aThe notion that Ronald Reagan was a racist is a misconception fueled by an obsessive focus on Reagan\u2019s opposition to the civil rights bills of the 1960s, which Reagan saw less as protecting rights for minorities than as advancing a covert expansion of ineffectual big government through redundant acts. Even this opposition, however, preceded his presidency and reflected the fact that his views on civil rights were not yet fully developed. As president, Reagan implemented a policy agenda that produced significant economic advancement in minority communities across the country, particularly aiding minority-owned family businesses and the Black community.\u000aDuring Reagan\u2019s presidency, Black-owned businesses saw revenues grow by an annual average of 7.9 percent. Reagan could have easily targeted his policies at helping large corporations, which were largely owned by Whites at the time, instead of small, minority-owned businesses (85% of small businesses paid their taxes by personal rates during the Reagan era versus the corporate rate large corporations tend to pay), but chose to focus his policies on these pillars of minority communities. Reagan understood what the Radical Republicans a century earlier did not: Without economic empowerment, legal and political rights for minorities\u2014even if backed by the letter of the law\u2014mean little. Reagan produced this economic empowerment by lowering the obstacles to economic growth, which allowed businesses to grow and hire more people, thus injecting new life into struggling communities. During his presidency, Black employment increased 15 percent overall, and the proportion of Black managers grew by 30 percent. The new economic opportunities produced during the Reagan boom also reached the Black professional class, which expanded by 63 percent. These economic gains helped Blacks and other minorities gain a more equal footing in American society.\u000aBarack Obama\u2019s economic record for Black Americans has been far worse, even after the recovery from the Great Recession. Black employment, adjusted for seasonal labor, actually dropped by 2.4 percent over the course of his presidency, and Black participation in the food stamp program exploded by nearly 60 percent. Median Black incomes dropped over the eight years of Obama\u2019s presidency, even including the economic recovery, while the Reagan years brought steady, strong increases in median Black earnings. When compared to Whites, Blacks did better economically in the Reagan years than the Obama years, the latter of which actually saw the racial wealth gap increase. \u000aVerdict: Not racist; in fact, his economic policies greatly advanced the interests of minorities, particularly the Black community.\u000aMYTH: Reagan\u2019s policies reveal a poor record on women\u2019s rights.\u000aFurther, liberals claim Reagan was a sexist who had a bad record on women\u2019s rights. This assertion is simply untrue\u2014even more ludicrous than the previous claims. Besides appointing the first female Supreme Court Justice\u2014Sandra Day O\u2019Connor\u2014Reagan also established the \u201cFifty States Project\u201d during his presidency. This program identified and worked to eliminate state laws and statutes that discriminated against women. His anti-drug policy, though much maligned today, did much to help women struggling to take care of their families while their partners abused drugs. Reagan\u2019s era also was marked by economic empowerment of the American people, regardless of race, religion, and sex. Female participation rate in the workforce grew during the eight years of Reagan\u2019s tenure, allowing for greater rates of female independence.\u000aVerdict: Not sexist\u000aMYTH: Reagan was anti-gay and refused to fund AIDS research.\u000aIn regard to the LGBT community, Reagan is often derided as a staunch anti-gay activist who refused to fund AIDS research\u2014but once again, his record proves otherwise. First clinically observed in the first year of Reagan\u2019s presidency, AIDS was a rather obscure disease. Most newly-discovered diseases receive poor funding because of their rarity and and a subsequent lack of incentive to develop treatments and cures. But despite the novelty of AIDS, the Reagan administration provided significant funding for AIDS research, which doubled or tripled during every year of Reagan\u2019s presidency, with $5 billion appropriated for AIDS research by the end of his presidency in 1989.\u000aWhen it came to LGBT rights, Reagan was surprisingly progressive for his era. As recently as 2004, modern political figures like Barack Obama were denouncing gay marriage. Even before he became president and jumpstarted AIDS research, as California governor Reagan came out against Proposition 6\u2014a ballot measure which would have barred LGBT people from teaching in the public school system. Opposing Proposition 6 was a risk to his political career, as supporting homosexual people was still politically dangerous at the time. Reagan\u2019s courageous activism turned out to be instrumental to Proposition 6\u2019s defeat.\u000aIn an era when homosexuality was commonly seen as a disease, Reagan proposed a strikingly modern view on sexuality in the course of his opposition to Proposition 6, writing that \u201chomosexuality is not a contagious disease like measles. Prevailing scientific opinion is that an individual\u2019s sexuality is determined at a very early age and that a child\u2019s teachers do not really influence this.\u201d\u000aVerdict: Not homophobic\u000a\u2014-\u000aReagan was no oppressor; indeed, he unlocked opportunity for millions of Americans to pursue their dreams and earn a new place in society. And with the presidency of Donald Trump, the Republican Party may just be shifting back to what Reagan envisioned. Trump\u2019s proposed tax cuts and simplification of the tax code are reminiscent to Reagan\u2019s highly successful economic measures, and a simplified tax code levels the playing field, helping the poor and middle class by making the tax code intelligible to them and lessening the need to spend money on CPAs and tax preparers during tax season.\u000aTrump\u2019s promises to bring new opportunity to inner-city neighborhoods, to lower taxes on small businesses\u2014many of which are minority owned\u2014and to give the choice of schooling to poor minority students trapped in failing public schools revives much of Reagan\u2019s policy of economic empowerment. Trump has been the most LGBT-friendly Republican president, and his efforts to spearhead women-owned businesses have all proved that he may just be taking the same path Reagan did thirty years ago. To the liberal college students throughout the nation, maybe it is time to see Reagan and even our current president in a different light\u2014-far from being bullies, they are hopes for the marginalized today.

aS'UPDATE: In Unprecedented Move, CMC Faculty Permits Seniors Who Violated Student Code to Graduate'
p203
aVClaremont McKenna College (CMC) told the Independent in a statement that its faculty voted in May to allow CMC seniors who violated the student code during a protest in early April aimed at preventing Heather Mac Donald from speaking at the college to partake in commencement exercises despite their conduct. According to an internal letter obtained by the Independent, this move is an unprecedented, break from the college\u2019s standard approach to disciplinary cases.\u000aIn the letter to CMC faculty, Dean of Faculty Peter Uvin stated that \u201c[h]istorically, when faced with comparable circumstances, the College has typically implemented an expedited conduct review process so that the matter can be resolved prior to Commencement \u2026 However, in the interests of overall fairness and consistency with respect to all Respondents, it is not appropriate to implement an expedited review process in any of these [protesters\u2019] cases. And hence, as said, the process may well take until after Commencement.\u201d\u000a\u201cThe College has never let a student walk who did not fulfill all requirements for the degree,\u201d he continued.\u000aIn the same letter, Dean Uvin emphasized the gravity of the student code violations: \u000a\u201cThe charges against these students are sufficiently significant for the College to have activated the procedure that carries the highest potential sanctions, including suspension or expulsion. It is wrong to let students, over whom such significant doubts as to their good standing exist, graduate from the College as if these concerns did not exist.\u201d\u000aYet in a statement to the Independent, the college confirmed that its faculty did ultimately vote to allow seniors who transgressed the student code amid the protests to walk at graduation, despite its promise to investigate and sanction students who had violated policy. \u000aThe faculty\u2019s decision to permit seniors who violated the student code to participate in commencement exercises came after CMC refused to give into a student group demanding the exoneration of all students under investigation. The group, which identified itself as the \u201cCMCers of Color,\u201d had expressed concern that sanctions for protesters might impact the employment prospects of graduates who violated college policy, writing that \u201cCMC has threatened to prevent students [who violated the student code] from walking at graduation and holds the power to withhold transcripts, barring students entrance into a competitive job market.\u201d\u000aAsked about the faculty\u2019s decision, the college insisted that permitting seniors under investigation to walk at graduation would not impact the sanctions process:\u000a\u201cThe faculty voted to let all seniors who had fulfilled all academic requirements for the degree walk in commencement. That includes a number of seniors who were, and still are, subject to a continuing conduct investigation and review process.\u201d\u000aBased on Uvin\u2019s letter and the college\u2019s statement to the Independent, it is clear that the faculty chose to award seniors their degrees on a conditional basis:\u000a\u201c[Motion 1] The faculty hereby conditionally grants those students who are currently the subject of a Conduct Investigation and Review process under the Student Conduct Process and who otherwise have fulfilled all the academic requirements for graduation, the degree of Bachelor of Arts, conditional on the completion of the Student Conduct Process, and either (i) a finding of non-responsibility or (ii) a finding of responsibility followed by the completion of any applied sanctions.\u201d\u000aDean Uvin\u2019s letter also listed a second motion that would have barred seniors from walking at commencement until the completion of the investigation and the fulfillment of any punitive sanctions:\u000a\u201cMotion 2. (only applicable if motion 1 carries) Students whose degree is granted conditionally will be eligible to participate in the first Commencement ceremony following the completion of the Conduct Process \u2026 The College has never let a student walk who did not fulfill all requirements for the degree. If we voted to award the degree conditionally\u2014for we believe that unresolved major concerns about students\u2019 good standing preclude us from awarding their degree at this moment\u2014then it automatically follows that we should not allow these students to walk at this time, but only after they received the degree.\u201d\u000aIf the second motion were adopted, Dean Uvin clarified, two scenarios could take place:\u000a\u201cIf the conduct matter is fully resolved, including the satisfaction or completion of any sanctions, prior to the close of regular business hours on May 12, 2017, the student shall be eligible to participate in the Commencement Ceremony on May 13, 2017.\u000aIf the conduct matter is not fully resolved by May 12th, the student shall be eligible to participate in the first Commencement Ceremony following the completion of the conduct process, including the satisfaction or completion of any sanctions. Example: A student is found responsible, and the sanctions include the deferral of the student\u2019s degree until the end of the summer or fall 2017 semester.\u201d\u000aBased on CMC\u2019s statement to the Independent, however, it is clear that the second motion failed, with the faculty voting instead to allow seniors still under investigation who fulfilled academic requirements to walk in commencement.\u000aIn the same statement, the college took care to emphasize that the investigation is ongoing and that faculty would not be involved in the sanctioning process once the investigation is complete:\u000a\u201cWhile we cannot discuss details of ongoing conduct cases, per our Student Conduct Process, if any student\u2014of whatever year\u2014is found responsible for violations of policy, sanctions will be determined by a designated sanctioning officer, not by the faculty. Upon any finding of responsibility, such sanctions will be implemented.\u201d\u000aAfter repeated requests for comment from the Independent, the assistant to Dean Uvin said that Uvin is in meetings \u201cliterally all day every day\u201d until he leaves campus for vacation and thus could not answer any questions.\u000aElliot Dordick contributed reporting. \u000aShare this:Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)MoreClick to print (Opens in new window)Click to share on Pinterest (Opens in new window)Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)Click to share on Google+ (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Tags: Claremont McKenna College CMC Heather Mac Donald Protest SJWCategories: Campus News

aS'College: Student Mentors With Drug Problems, Mental Illness Can Keep Their Jobs'
p207
aVIn a meeting with administrators at Pomona College in April, student \u201csponsors\u201d called upon the college to end its alleged practice of removing sponsors \u2014 second-year students who mentor and support incoming freshmen \u2014 from their posts on the basis of mental health problems or substance abuse. Asked for comment, the college\u2019s residential life administrators explained that they do not fire sponsors on this basis.\u000aThe sponsor program is intended to help first-year students adjust to their first year of college, providing a \u201csafe, welcoming\u201d social group that also enables them to connect with students beyond their class year. On its website, the college describes the sponsor program as \u201ca residential program through which all first-year [freshman] students are housed with approximately 15 other first-years led by two students called sponsors. More recently, sponsors have been sophomores \u2026 The main objective of the program is to assist in the transition to college by creating a safe, welcoming and sustainable living environment for all first-years as well as increasing interactions with older students.\u201d\u000aDuring the forum with administrators, current sponsors claimed that the residential life office had terminated sponsors for abusing drugs or having a mental illness. Doing so, they said, demonstrates a lack of inclusion for students with mental health and substance abuse problems, whose experiences are valuable for incoming freshmen:\u000a\u201cDon\u2019t cut sponsor for substance or mental health reasons \u2013 just, seriously, stop \u2026 We should value these individuals for their experiences,\u201d they said, according to the transcript.\u000aWhen the Independent inquired about this policy with college administrators, the Office of Housing and Residence Life responded to \u201cconfirm that we do not remove Sponsors based on mental health and/or substance abuse issues.\u201d The office did not say whether this policy marks a change from previous practice or has been the college\u2019s approach in the past.\u000aHowever, some parents are concerned about the college\u2019s practice. In an email, a parent of a Pomona freshman told the Independent that sponsors should not have a history of mental illness or addiction:\u000a\u201cGiven that the primary task of a sponsor is to oversee and care for freshman, full competence should be prioritized,\u201d the parent said. \u201cWhile Pomona should uphold the value of inclusion, it is not fair or right to burden freshman with a mentally challenged or ex/current drug using individual. All sponsors should be focused on the responsibility of helping freshman. They should be role models which is difficult when mental illness or addiction is involved.\u201d\u000aAt the same forum, current sponsors urged administrators to phase out the standard cover letter/resume application to be a sponsor in favor of a student-run selection process, marginalizing the role of college officials in choosing the next year\u2019s crop of student mentors.\u000aThey also demanded that the college release the whereabouts of \u201cat-risk\u201d students in each sponsor group to sponsors via an \u201cautomated email system,\u201d as well as to \u201cprovide some form of compensation, not necessarily monetary, to Sponsor[s] for their work.\u201d\u000aAt present, the sponsor role is an unpaid position that is by application only. At the forum, students and administrators alike noted that high student interest in the position is typical.\u000aShare this:Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)MoreClick to print (Opens in new window)Click to share on Pinterest (Opens in new window)Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)Click to share on Google+ (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Categories: Campus News

aVIn an official statement to the Independent, Claremont McKenna College resolved once more to \u201chold students accountable\u201d for policy violations committed during the protest of scholar Heather Mac Donald in early April, rejecting demands by a student group for the college to end its investigation and abstain from punishing rule breakers.\u000aThe statement, issued only hours after the students\u2019 demands for exoneration, expresses the college\u2019s full commitment to an April 7 promise from CMC President Hiram Chodosh to crack down on those protesters who defied regulations by blockading the entrances and exits to the Marian Miner Cook Athenaeum to prevent anyone from entering the building to hear Mac Donald\u2019s talk.\u000aThe full statement is below:\u000a\u201cThe College is following through on President Chodosh\u2019s commitment to hold students accountable. As is the case with any and all alleged violations of the Student Code of Conduct and College policies, CMC is following our established Student Conduct Process which can be found in the Guide to Student Life.\u000aWe have begun the conduct review process with individual CMC students, who will be afforded a full, fair, and impartial process before the determination of findings, sanctions, and appeals. Over the course of the next few weeks, students who are found responsible for violations of College policy will face sanctions appropriate to the severity of the violation.\u000aWe acknowledge the community\u2019s desire for information and details; however, to ensure a fair process that protects the interests of our students, while complying with our policies and FERPA, we cannot disclose any additional information about an ongoing process.\u201d\u000aShare this:Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)MoreClick to print (Opens in new window)Click to share on Pinterest (Opens in new window)Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)Click to share on Google+ (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Categories: Campus News

aS'After Breaking Rules During Protest, Students Demand Exoneration'
p215
aVIn an open letter to top officials and the Board of Trustees at Claremont McKenna College, a group of students identified as the \u201cCMCers of Color\u201d criticizes the college\u2019s effort to punish students who violated college policy while protesting conservative scholar Heather Mac Donald as the \u201cfurther criminalization of already marginalized students\u201d and calls upon the college to end its \u201cinvestigation.\u201d\u000aThe letter comes as Hiram Chodosh, the president of CMC, fulfills his vow to punish students who defied college regulations in the course of the protests.\u000a\u201cBlocking access to buildings violates College policy,\u201d he wrote in an April 7 email, one day after protesters shut down Heather Mac Donald\u2019s talk by blockading the entrances to the Marian Miner Cook Athenaeum, where the Manhattan Institute scholar was scheduled to appear. \u201cCMC students who are found to have violated policies will be held accountable. We will also give a full report to the other Claremont Colleges, who have responsibility for their own students.\u201d\u000aMultiple sources report that the college analyzed photo and video evidence supplied by onlookers and student journalists to identify the individuals who violated campus rules at the protest and target them for sanctions.\u000aThe CMCers of Color, however, complain that these efforts to uphold college policy are \u201cdistressing\u201d and amount to \u201cacts of violence\u201d by the administration against students of color, whom they allege are the principal targets of the investigation:\u000a\u201cCMC has threatened to prevent students from walking at graduation and holds the power to withhold transcripts, barring students entrance into a competitive job market. CMC has also threatened suspension and expulsion. For low-income and first generation students, graduation is a culminatory moment that should not be revoked. On campuses where students of color already feel unsafe, it is distressing that these institutions resort to punitive measures to resolve issues resulting from their own negligence. These are acts of violence, and if advanced, would severely harm the survival of these students, particularly those of whom are graduating this coming week.\u201d\u000aThe CMCers of Color also criticize the college for inviting speakers like Mac Donald, speakers who, according to the group, endanger students of color:\u000a\u201cWhile inflammatory speakers are framed as generating open dialogue on campus, they merely create dangerous campus environments for students of color. The institution\u2019s financial backing of speakers who examine Black livelihood, suggesting its debatability, shows that fraudulent calls for open dialogue take precedence over students of color. CMC is effectively complicit in threats to the safety of students of color by legitimating the very politics that denies their humanity.\u201d\u000aThe letter further claims that \u201c[t]here has been no talk of investigation for violent counter protesters \u2014 only talk of further criminalization of already marginalized students.\u201d But Chodosh\u2019s original statement announcing the investigation stated that policy violators would be punished, and violence is against the student code.\u000aMoreover, several eyewitnesses consulted by the Independent recall seeing no violent counter protest at the event, and multiple videos taken at the scene corroborate this account. The witnesses also confirm that the protesters engaged in various forms of physical intimidation, including \u201cshoving, blocking,\u201d and \u201cforming human walls\u201d to ensure that no one could enter the Athenaeum to view Mac Donald\u2019s talk. Additionally, student journalists and onlookers, including but not limited to writers for the Independent, reported receiving threats of violence from students protesting Mac Donald. CMC\u2019s student code prohibits \u201cactions which cause, or could cause, personal injury or death,\u201d actions which include \u201cthreatening to assault\u201d or \u201cintimidating another person.\u201d\u000aConcluding their letter, the CMCers of Color call for an end to CMC\u2019s investigation. \u201cWe stand in solidarity with the actions taken against Mac Donald,\u201d they write, \u201cand we demand that the investigation and criminalization of CMC students stop immediately.\u201d\u000aThe signatories to the letter of the CMCers of Color are private; as such, it is unclear how many have signed it.\u000aRequests for comment from President Chodosh and other CMC officials were unanswered at the time of publication.\u000aShare this:Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)MoreClick to print (Opens in new window)Click to share on Pinterest (Opens in new window)Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)Click to share on Google+ (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Categories: Campus News

p219
aVIn an official statement, Pomona College has backed a geology professor who, in a flier advertising her permission-only course on earthquakes and hydrology, explained her plan to exercise preference for \u201cstudents of color\u201d and other marginalized individuals seeking to enroll in the course.\u000aThe statement of support comes after an alumnus of the Claremont Colleges filed a complaint with the Department of Education\u2019s Office of Civil Rights, accusing Linda Reinen, the geology professor, of discrimination on the basis of race, class, and citizenship.\u000a\u201cProfessor Reinen is asking students who wish to enroll in a college class to describe their racial and ethnic background, their socioeconomic background, their national origin and citizenship status (by asking for \u201cinternational\u201d students to identify as such), and potentially their age (with the information requested on where students are \u201cin their college career),\u201d the complaint stated. \u201cCollege students should never be asked, required, or expected to reveal such information as their racial and ethnic identity to a professor so [that] she may decide whether or not to allow them to enroll in her class.\u201d (emphasis original)\u000aThe Independent has also confirmed at least one report of a student who attempted to enroll in Reinen\u2019s course only to be urged by the professor to submit a new enrollment request, this time including information about the student\u2019s race, income, citizenship, and year in school.\u000a\u201cPlease take a look at the flyer I have attached and either modify your existing PERM [permission-to-enroll request] (if possible) or send a new PERM request with your response to the flyer,\u201d Reinen said in an email to the student, going on to quote the portion of her flyer indicating her preference for marginalized students. \u201cIn resolving PERMs I will strive to identify students for whom the small-section setting has the potential to be of particular benefit. I am especially interested in seeing PERM requests from students of color, first generation or low-income students, international, and students early in their college career (first two years).\u201d (emphasis original)\u000aBut in an official statement to the Independent, Pomona College affirmed the flier as a \u201cpositive outreach\u201d and stated that the professor\u2019s approach is both lawful and ethical:\u000a\u201cPomona College encourages all students to take courses across our broad curriculum as part of a full and vital liberal arts education. We strive to foster classroom environments where students from different backgrounds and experiences can learn and contribute in an atmosphere of open inquiry and intellectual engagement. The flier is a positive outreach designed to encourage a wide range of students to consider the class. The College fully supports this objective. This approach is fully within the law and meets strict ethical standards.\u201d\u000aAccording to recent policy guidance from the Department of Education\u2019s Office of Civil Rights, educational institutions are obligated to ensure that \u201cstudents have equal access to educational resources without regard to race, color, or national origin.\u201d\u000aShare this:Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)MoreClick to print (Opens in new window)Click to share on Pinterest (Opens in new window)Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)Click to share on Google+ (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Categories: Campus News

p227
aVAfter Pomona College\u2019s sociology department rejected students\u2019 demands for the rescission of a hiring offer to Alice Goffman on account of her allegedly \u201cracist\u201d and \u201cunethical\u201d research, students now have commanded the department to preclude Goffman from \u201cteaching required sociology courses\u201d and to fund a speaker series criticizing her work. The students have also announced a boycott of sociology courses at the college.\u000aThe students reiterated their earlier demands for control over hiring decisions and for a formal letter from the department, which now must contain a list of \u201cconcrete steps the Department will take moving forward to ensure such undemocratic, covert hiring processes are never repeated.\u201d\u000aAccording to the latest set of demands, Goffman should be \u201cprevented from teaching required sociology courses, including \u2026 Introduction to Sociology,\u201d though the students stipulate that \u201c[s]he can be allowed \u2026 to teach non-required sociology electives.\u201d The students also request that Pomona College sociology students be granted the ability to take their required sociology courses at other colleges\u2014or simply not take them at all, enrolling in alternative courses \u201cin different academic departments (Anthropology, ethnic studies, etc.)\u201d to fulfill the requirements of the sociology department.\u000aIn their first set of demands, students lambasted the department for hiring Goffman, a White woman, over two Black candidates. To mitigate the possibility of this oversight occurring in the future, they now are seeking \u201cthe creation of an additional tenure line that prioritizes representation from a diverse pool of applicants.\u201d The students also reiterate their demand for \u201cthe creation of peer-appointed, influential student positions on the hiring committee\u201d to \u201cbe at the forefront of all current and future hiring decisions in the Sociology Department. The current lack of transparency and student input on hiring decisions is not an issue unique to the Sociology Department, but is a recurring pattern throughout the College.\u201d\u000a\u201cAn adequately-funded speaker and workshop series to occur monthly for the duration of Alice Goffman\u2019s professorship\u201d is the next demand from the students. Though the series would only feature Goffman\u2019s critics, the students explain that \u201cthis series will ensure an open democratic debate about the merits of Goffman\u2019s work by bringing her most serious critics to the Claremont Colleges to speak. We hope to feature diverse academics who exemplify ethical, reciprocal, mutually beneficial, and community-grounded research.\u201d\u000aThe students want the department to \u201chire a staff member to coordinate this series in collaboration with Sociology students.\u201d \u201cIf this is not possible,\u201d they helpfully add, \u201cwe are open to having Sociology students/student organizers receive financial compensation to coordinate the series.\u201d\u000aThe final demand is for an explanation of Goffman\u2019s hiring from the department\u2019s hiring committee. This letter must detail \u201cfurther rationale and transparency that led to Goffman\u2019s hiring decision,\u201d including \u201ca discussion of Goffman\u2019s credentials in relation to the posted job description.\u201d The students further demand that the department explain \u201cthe lack of representative student involvement in the hiring process\u201d and detail the \u201cconcrete steps [it] will take moving forward to ensure such undemocratic, covert hiring processes are never repeated.\u201d\u000aOn Friday, in the hopes of putting pressure on the department, the students behind the demands began sharing a Facebook post urging other students at the colleges, \u201cas part of being in solidarity,\u201d to \u201cunregister from Pomona College Sociology courses for the Fall 2017 semester.\u201d\u000aThe Department of Sociology has not yet responded to the Independent\u2019s request for comment. This story will be updated upon receipt of a response.

aS'Pomona Sociology Dept. Backs White Professor Despite Student Demands'
p231
aVIn a letter sent Friday, Pomona College\u2019s Sociology Department rejected student demands for the rescission of a hiring offer to Dr. Alice Goffman, defending their decision to choose the \u201clegendary\u201d and well-qualified teacher to fill an open professorship in the department.\u000aAfter receiving the demand letter from \u201ca pseudonymous email account,\u201d the Sociology Department, in its response letter, refuted the claims of the students and, in line with the response from College administration, reaffirmed its decision to hire Goffman.\u000aThe students believe that Goffman\u2014who was hired over two Black candidates\u2014should not be hired because \u201cthe national controversy around Alice Goffman\u2019s academic integrity, dubious integrity, her hyper-criminalization of Black men, and hyper-sexualization of Black women does not embrace and align with our shared community values.\u201d \u000aThe Sociology Department does not share the students\u2019 sentiments about Goffman:\u000a\u201cWe reject the premise that Alice Goffman\u2019s work hyper-criminalizes and hyper-sexualizes African-Americans. In fact, her book is widely regarded as a sympathetic and humanizing portrait of an over-policed community, and has been part of the national conversation about racial disparities in crime and incarceration. There have been, as there always are, scholarly critiques of the book\u2019s methods and findings. Such debate is to be expected and encouraged in the academic community.\u201d\u000aResponding to concerns that Goffman\u2019s hire does not align with the students\u2019 definition of sociology\u2014\u201c[critiquing] elitism and interlocking systems of domination and power\u201d\u2014the Department asserts that the students have a faulty definition of sociology:\u000a\u201cWe reject the characterization of sociology as a field that critiques elitism and power. Rather, sociology is a discipline that seeks to uncover the social processes that underlie seemingly individual experiences, which may or may not involve critique.\u201d\u000aThe Department also refutes student concerns that Goffman\u2019s critically-acclaimed book, On the Run, and the research behind it, are \u201cracist, sensationalist and unethical,\u201d and that Goffman employs \u201charmful research methods\u201d:\u000a\u201cThe methods of On the Run, while controversial, have not been found to be unethical. The University of Wisconsin conducted an internal review in response to the inappropriately anonymous critique mentioned in your letter and uncovered no wrongdoing. Further, it is publicly known that Goffman shares the royalties from her work with her research subjects and continues to have warm, personal relationships with them to this day.\u201d\u000aWhile the Department does support \u201cthe creation of peer-appointed, influential student positions on the hiring committee\u201d and faculty that better reflects the department\u2019s students, as demanded by the students, it states that such changes in policy are out of the Department\u2019s control:\u000a\u201cWe agree that the Sociology Department should better reflect the diversity of its majors. In fact, for years, the Department has sought an additional tenure line for this purpose, but has not been given that support by the administration\u2026we are supportive of the possibility of elected, voting student members of a search committee. [But] [t]his would require a change in College-wide policy.\u201d\u000aHowever, the Department also believes Goffman sufficiently fulfills the diversity requirement, stating that \u201cGoffman is also known as a legendary teacher, even at this early stage in her career, who works closely with all students, especially students from diverse backgrounds.\u201d\u000aThe two other candidates for the position\u2014Dr. Marla Kohlman of Kenyon College and Dr. Katrina Bell McDonald of Johns Hopkins University\u2014have not received controversy for their work, but they have also not been under the national spotlight as Goffman has.\u000aKohlman received her degrees from Haverford College, American University, and the University of Maryland, College Park. Her work focuses on \u201cinstitutional frameworks of inequality (gender, race, class, sexuality, etc.).\u201d\u000aMcDonald received her degrees from Mills College, Stanford University, and the University of California, Davis. Her work centers around \u201chow life is lived at the margins of society for disadvantaged social groups, such as racial, gender, and class minorities.\u201d She has written a book titled Embracing Sisterhood: Class, Identity, and Contemporary Black Women.\u000aGoffman, meanwhile, wrote the critically acclaimed On the Run, which made the New York Times\u2019 \u201c100 notable books of 2014\u201d list. She received her degrees from the University of Pennsylvania and Princeton University, and has received the \u201c2011 Dissertation Award\u201d by the American Sociological Association for \u201cthe best Ph.D. dissertation for a calendar year.\u201d\u000aShare this:Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)MoreClick to print (Opens in new window)Click to share on Pinterest (Opens in new window)Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)Click to share on Google+ (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Categories: Campus News

We are pleased that this process resulted in an offer and an acceptance.\u201d\u000aAlthough the letter complains that Goffman is \u201cracist, sensationalist, and unethical,\u201d and criticizes the College for hiring Goffman\u2014a White female\u2014over \u201cthe two other candidates for this position [who] were highly qualified Black women,\u201d Pomona\u2019s Dean of Academic Affairs, Audrey Bilger, defended the College\u2019s hiring process as rigorous and diversity-minded, as the process \u201cincludes a range of activities, from a public presentation to faculty and students to meeting with our faculty diversity officer.\u201d\u000aGoffman is a well-known sociologist who attended the University of Pennsylvania and Princeton University for her undergraduate studies and doctorate program respectively, and her book On the Run has received positive critical acclaim from leading sociologists such as William Julius Wilson. On the Run is also well-known in non-academic circles, making the New York Times\u2019 \u201c100 notable books of 2014\u201d list.\u000aGoffman also received the \u201c2011 Dissertation Award\u201d by the American Sociological Association for \u201cthe best Ph.D dissertation for a calendar year.\u201d\u000aShare this:Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)MoreClick to print (Opens in new window)Click to share on Pinterest (Opens in new window)Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)Click to share on Google+ (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Categories: Campus News

aVIn an open letter to Pomona College\u2019s Sociology Department, Dean of Academic Affairs, and President, an anonymous group of 128 students, alumni, and \u201callies\u201d of the Sociology Department demand that the college rescind its offer to hire \u201cracist\u201d and \u201cunethical\u201d Dr. Alice Goffman as a sociology professor and turn over control of future hiring to students.\u000a\u201cWe, a collective of Sociology students, alumni, and allies at Pomona College, are writing to express our anger and concern regarding the recent hire of Alice Goffman. Goffman\u2019s hire proves the college\u2019s failure to wholeheartedly address underrepresentation of faculty of color \u2026 [T]he national controversy around Alice Goffman\u2019s academic integrity, dubious reputation, her hyper-criminalization of Black men, and hyper-sexualization of Black women does not embrace and align with our shared community values,\u201d the letter begins.\u000a\u201cTo this end, we demand \u2026 the rescindment of the offer to hire Alice Goffman as the McConnell Visiting Professor of Sociology,\u201d the authors write. \u201cIn the case that she has accepted the offer, we demand the termination of her contract.\u201d\u000aThe open letter also demands \u201cthe creation of peer-appointed, influential student positions on the hiring committee\u201d that place students \u201cat the forefront of all current and future hiring decisions in the Sociology Department.\u201d\u000aOne major problem with Goffman, according to the letter, is that she is a White female who was chosen over two Black candidates. \u201c[T]he two other candidates for this position were highly qualified Black women whose critical research focuses on intersectionality and structural inequality,\u201d the authors write. \u201c[This hire] boasts the framework that white women can theorize about and profit from Black lives while giving no room for Black academics to claim scholarship regarding their own lived experiences.\u201d\u000aIn a message to the Independent, an anonymous Pomona student who attended presentations by candidates for the position explained \u201cthat as someone who went to the presentations, I did think Alice [Goffman]\u2019s was the most coherent and put-together.\u201d\u000aGoffman gave her presentation on \u201cMapping the Fatefulness of Everyday Life,\u201d while the other two candidates, Dr. Katrina Bell McDonald and Dr. Marla Kohlman discussed \u201cIntersecting Race and Gender\u201d and \u201cIntersectionality: Politics and Praxis,\u201d respectively.\u000aGoffman is known for her work on the impact of mass incarceration and policing in low-income African-American communities, but students believe her work disqualifies her from teaching at Pomona College. \u000a\u201cHer [Goffman\u2019s] methods have endangered her research participants, encouraged the hyper-policing of Black communities, and continue to perpetuate anti-Blackness,\u201d the students write. \u201cAdditionally, hiring white faculty who engage in voyeuristic, unethical research and who are not mindful of their positionality as outsiders to the communities they study reinforces harmful narratives about people of color. This practice is detrimental to Pomona\u2019s goal of supporting students of color; we condemn the harm Goffman\u2019s research has caused Black communities.\u201d \u000aThe letter goes on to accuse Goffman\u2019s publications of being \u201cracist, sensationalist, and unethical.\u201d \u000aThe students also are seeking a formal letter from the sociology department detailing where it went wrong in choosing Goffman for the position:\u000a\u201cWe are requesting a formal letter recognizing the flawed process of hiring Goffman and how from now on, student involvement will be central to such decisions. We ask that the faculty committee exercise greater transparency by explicitly detailing the hiring procedure and addressing the lack of communication with students regarding the faculty opening and potential candidates. Since faculty are in positions to influence and inspire the student body, it is very important that students are made aware of and involved in hiring practices that directly impact our college experiences.\u201d\u000aThe letter\u2019s authors also claim that the \u201cmajority of Sociology majors are students of color\u201d and complain that \u201cthe faculty are not at all representative of their students\u2019 diversity.\u201d They also ask for more professors of color in all fields, as it \u201cis deeply concerning [that there are not more professors of color] given that the percentage of students of color has been increasing with each admitted class, with the Class of 2021 consisting of 56.7% students of color.\u201d \u000aAlthough the Sociology Department does currently include faculty of color, the students are not satisfied, as the hire of Goffman\u2014a White female\u2014will mean that \u201cthe Department will have zero women of color faculty members.\u201d (emphasis original)  \u000aThe letter claims to have garnered 128 signatures, but this is impossible to verify, as none of the signatories\u2019 names are listed.\u000a\u201c128 names [have been] redacted for individual safety in recognition of the violence inflicted on communities of color by various publications, namely the Claremont Independent,\u201d the authors explain.\u000aThe college has until 5:00 p.m. next Tuesday to respond\u2014or else, say the authors.\u000a\u201cShould we not receive a response to our demands,\u201d they write, \u201cwe will take direct action.\u201d (emphasis original)\u000aShare this:Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)MoreClick to print (Opens in new window)Click to share on Pinterest (Opens in new window)Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)Click to share on Google+ (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Categories: Campus News

aS'Pomona Professor to Admit Students to Geology Class On Basis of Race'
p243
aVIn a flyer introducing her course on \u201cSouthern California Earthquakes and Water,\u201d a geology professor at Pomona College sells her class as an intriguing hands-on look at the unique \u201ctectonic and hydrologic challenges\u201d faced in the Golden State. She then explains how she will exercise racial preference in choosing which students may enroll in the course.\u000aUnlike in most Pomona classes, seats in the earthquakes course are offered on a permission-only basis, which means that students must submit a written request\u2014colloquially called a \u201cPERM\u201d\u2014to the professor seeking \u201cpermission to enroll.\u201d The professor sees all of these requests and may choose among them to fill his or her course.\u000aTypically, professors treat PERMs as a waitlist, selecting students in the order in which they submitted their PERM requests. To the extent that preferential treatment is exercised, it is typically used to ensure that students majoring in a particular field of study are able to enroll in courses for their major ahead of others, who may simply be taking them to fulfill general education requirements.\u000aLinda Reinen, who will teach the earthquakes course this fall, plans to use her approval authority to prefer students from marginalized backgrounds, such as non-Whites and low-income students, who she believes will derive \u201cparticular benefit\u201d from a smaller and less competitive course.\u000a\u201cI encourage students who PERM this course to indicate how their background, experience, and/or interests could contribute to diversifying perspectives in the course,\u201d she writes. \u201cIn resolving PERMs I will strive to identify students for whom the small-section setting has the potential to be of particular benefit. I am especially interested in seeing PERM requests from students of color, first generation or low-income students, international, and students early in their college career (first two years); such students are especially encouraged to apply.\u201d (emphasis original)\u000aReinen does not explain how preferential approval on the basis of race, income, national origin, or age might provide a tangible benefit in a course on geological science or why the students she prefers stand to benefit more from a small-section class than other students.\u000aProfessor Reinen did not respond to the Independent\u2019s requests for comment.\u000aShare this:Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)MoreClick to print (Opens in new window)Click to share on Pinterest (Opens in new window)Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)Click to share on Google+ (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Categories: Campus News

aS'Taking Advantage of Holiday Absences, Pitzer Senate Boycotts Israeli Products'
p247
aVOn April 16, a date marking Easter Sunday and the Jewish holiday of Passover, 22 of the 43 Pitzer College Student Senate members voted on and approved an amendment to its \u201cBudget Committee Bylaws\u201d to boycott Israeli products with the entirety of its $270,000+ \u201cStudent Activities Funds\u201d budget, which is funded through a mandatory $135 semesterly \u201cStudent Activities fee\u201d ($270 per academic year) that the college collects from every Pitzer student and gives directly to the Student Senate.\u000aOnly 26 senators attended the vote, which occurred just one week after \u201cIsraeli Apartheid Week\u201d during which Students for Justice in Palestine (SJP) placed a \u201cmock Israeli apartheid wall\u201d in the center of campus. 22 senators supported the boycott amendment, while 4 abstained, 0 were opposed, and 17 were absent from the meeting.\u000aThe updated bylaws, including amended language, can be found in Article III of the bylaws available on the school website. Under the new bylaws, the only restrictions on the use of Student Activities funds are:\u000a\u201cI. Student Activities Funds shall not be used for the purchase of any illegal substances, as defined by all local, state, and federal laws.\u000aII. Student Activities Funds shall not be used for the purchase of any weapons, firearms, and/or explosives, with an exception for kitchen tools, art supplies, and gardening equipment.\u000aIII. Student Activities Funds shall not be used for the purchase of any individual single-use plastic water bottles.\u000aIV. Student Activities Funds shall not be used for the purchase of any alcohol and tobacco products.\u000aV. Student Activities Funds shall not be used for the purchase of any gift cards.\u000aVI. Student Activities Funds shall not be used to make a payment on goods or services from any corporation or organization associated with the unethical occupation of Palestinian territories. Products include those products from corporations and organizations as delineated in the boycott list maintained by bdsmovement.net/get-involved/what-toboycott.\u201d\u000aThis move to endorse the \u201cBoycott, Divest, and Sanctions\u201d movement shatters precedent at Pitzer College and has already provoked strong reactions from Jewish, pro-Israel, and pro-Palestine student groups on campus.\u000aMica Laber (CMC \u201918), a leader of the Claremont Progressive Israel Alliance (CPIA), told the Independent that the circumstances of the vote, occurring \u201cwhen a significant portion of the student leadership was absent \u2026 made clear the intentions to avoid any sort of productive debate.\u201d\u000aLaber added that \u201cStudent Senate leaders should have included the proposed amendment in the agenda prior to the meeting because this is an issue that students on campus are passionate about\u201d and \u201cmany would have liked the opportunity to voice their opinions before any vote was called.\u201d\u000aStudents from both the CPIA and the Alpha Epsilon Pi fraternity chapter on campus signed an online petition arguing not only against BDS, but also that the nature of the vote made its passage \u201cunfair and purposefully unrepresentative of the student body.\u201d\u000aDespite the concerns of their peers, Claremont SJP released a statement describing the budget amendment as \u201can important victory.\u201d\u000aShare this:Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)MoreClick to print (Opens in new window)Click to share on Pinterest (Opens in new window)Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)Click to share on Google+ (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Categories: Campus News

p251
aVThe authors of the open letter that called objective truth a \u201cmyth and white supremacy\u201d and sought disciplinary action against conservative journalists on campus are now demanding compensation for their \u201clabor\u201d from \u201cnon-Black allies.\u201d\u000aAccording to a screenshot sent to the Claremont Independent, one of the authors took to a Facebook group to reiterate his critiques of the email from Pomona College President David Oxtoby that originally prompted the letter and to seek financial support from \u201cnon-Black\u201d students and allies beyond the Claremont Colleges.\u000aIn that original email, Oxtoby defended the value of free speech on campus and emphasized Pomona\u2019s commitment to \u201cthe exercise of free speech and academic freedom\u201d in the aftermath of protests that shut down a scheduled talk by Heather Mac Donald, a noted scholar and critic of Black Lives Matter, at the adjacent campus of Claremont McKenna College.\u000aIn his Facebook post, the author blasted Oxtoby\u2019s statement and assailed the \u201cnormalization of antiblackness at the Claremont Colleges, particularly Pomona.\u201d\u000a\u201cThe response from the president of the College condones hate speech towards Black bodies as a form of free speech, while simultaneously berating those students of marginalized identities who protest for their right to safely exist that [sic] these institutions,\u201d the author wrote. \u201cThis college would rather protect the right to verbally degrade Black people than to protect Black lives, especially those of the students at their campus; hinting at the inevitable vulgarity of whiteness and white supremacy.\u201d\u000a\u201cWe ask that other Black students and non-black allies from the [Claremont Colleges\u2019] community and beyond to support us with this endeavor to hold our administration accountable,\u201d he continued.\u000aThe author went on to admonish his \u201cnon-black allies\u201d to pay him and the other two individuals responsible for the original open letter for their \u201clabor.\u201d\u000a\u201cAlso \u2018allies\u2019 and other folks, if you receive social capital from sharing this letter, you should provide the organizers of this movement with tangible capital and compensate us for our labor,\u201d he urged, appending the usernames for the Venmo accounts of himself and the other authors of the open letter to the end of his post.\u000aVenmo is a payment service app that is used to send money directly to friends and make purchases.\u000aShare this:Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)MoreClick to print (Opens in new window)Click to share on Pinterest (Opens in new window)Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)Click to share on Google+ (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Categories: Campus News

aS'Scripps Alumnae Demand That College Submits to Student Demands'
p255
aVAlumnae of Scripps College are circulating a petition demanding that the college submit to the demands of resident advisors on campus, who announced a strike last week to force the firing of the current Dean of Students and radical changes to campus policies with respect to financial aid, mental health, and residential life.\u000a\u201cWe, on behalf of graduates/alumnae(i) of Scripps College, are shocked and outraged at recent events that have unfolded at Scripps,\u201d the petition begins. \u201cWe firmly stand in solidarity with the current Scripps RAs\u2019 strike in response to the administration\u2019s lack of response to these events as well as to several of Scripps\u2019 chronic and long-standing policies and practices.\u201d\u000aLast week, Lara Tiedens, the president of Scripps College, refused to capitulate to student demands and took immediate action to replace the resident advisors (RAs), who take the lead in ensuring student safety within the residence halls and handling unexpected emergencies, with regular security patrols.\u000a\u201cThis afternoon, a group of Resident Advisors (RAs) informed me of their intent to go on strike effective immediately, and to abstain from all duties including crisis and emergency response, residential life programming, and other assigned duties,\u201d Tiedens wrote in an April 14 email to current Scripps students and parents. \u201c[M]aintaining a supportive, safe, and high-quality living and learning environment for all students is our highest priority, and the College\u2019s immediate focus is on ensuring we have appropriate coverage for the residence halls. To that end, the Dean of Students has developed a plan to ensure that RAs\u2019 critical duties related to safety and student welfare are covered for the duration of the strike.\u201d\u000aTiedens\u2019 refusal to capitulate to the RAs\u2019 demands does not sit well with the authors of the alumnae petition.\u000a\u201cWe are deeply concerned about your callous response to the RA strike, which did not address any of the causes of students\u2019 exhaustion and exploitation, but instead defended an administrator who multiple students have testified is abusive and criticized the strike when many other methods of engaging with administration have been tried by students, but did not prove effective,\u201d they write. \u201cThis is a prime example of how Scripps appears to not be genuinely listening or acknowledging the community\u2019s serious and deep state of grief.\u201d\u000aThe alumnae petition also complains that the college\u2019s decision to hire additional staff to stand in for the striking RAs could evoke fears of \u201cpolice brutality\u201d among the student body.\u000a\u201cScripps\u2019 only real action in response to the strike has been to hire an outside security firm to police the campus, which only serves to instill fear in students, especially students of color who have personally been or have witnessed their family and friends of color being targets of police brutality and criminalization,\u201d it explains.\u000aAttached to the alumnae letter is a \u201ctimeline\u201d that demonstrates the \u201clong history of student activism on campus.\u201d The listed events include a \u201cUnited Against Hate protest across the [Claremont] campuses following the election of another fascist white supremacist,\u201d presumably referring to current U.S. president Donald J. Trump, as well as the student-led protests that shut down a scheduled event with Heather Mac Donald, an expert on urban crime and policing, at Claremont McKenna College\u2019s Athenaeum. The timeline helpfully notes that Mac Donald \u201cbelieves the Black Lives Matter narrative is not only false but dangerous.\u201d\u000aOver 200 alumnae have signed the petition, which closes by admonishing the college once more to capitulate to student demands:\u000a\u201cAs past students of Scripps College, we demand that there be systemic change at Scripps, pursuant to the thoughtful, well-articulated demands of the current RAs. We stand in strong support of their cause, and would vehemently urge the Scripps administration to listen carefully to the RAs\u2019 voices, and to make a genuine, concerted, and good faith effort to comply with their demands.\u201d\u000aShare this:Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)MoreClick to print (Opens in new window)Click to share on Pinterest (Opens in new window)Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)Click to share on Google+ (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Categories: Campus News

aS'Students Demand Administrators \xe2\x80\x98Take Action\xe2\x80\x99 Against Conservative Journalists'
p259
aVIn an open letter to outgoing Pomona College President David Oxtoby, a group of students from the Claremont Colleges assail the president for affirming Pomona\u2019s commitment to free speech and demand that all five colleges \u201ctake action\u201d against the conservative journalists on the staff of the Claremont Independent.\u000aThe letter, written by three self-identified Black students at Pomona College, is a response to an April 7 email from President Oxtoby in which he reiterated the college\u2019s commitment to \u201cthe exercise of free speech and academic freedom\u201d in the aftermath of protests that shut down a scheduled appearance by an invited speaker, scholar and Black Lives Matter critic Heather Mac Donald, on April 6.\u000a\u201cProtest has a legitimate and celebrated place on college campuses,\u201d Oxtoby wrote. \u201cWhat we cannot support is the act of preventing others from engaging with an invited speaker. Our mission is founded upon the discovery of truth, the collaborative development of knowledge and the betterment of society.\u201d\u000aIn their open letter, the students sharply disagree.\u000a\u201cFree speech, a right many freedom movements have fought for, has recently become a tool appropriated by hegemonic institutions. It has not just empowered students from marginalized backgrounds to voice their qualms and criticize aspects of the institution, but it has given those who seek to perpetuate systems of domination a platform to project their bigotry,\u201d they write.\u000a\u201cThus, if \u2018our mission is founded upon the discovery of truth,\u2019\u201d the students continue, citing Oxtoby\u2019s letter, \u201chow does free speech uphold that value?\u201d\u000aThe students also characterize truth as a \u201cmyth\u201d and a white supremacist concept. \u000a\u201cHistorically, white supremacy has venerated the idea of objectivity, and wielded a dichotomy of \u2018subjectivity vs. objectivity\u2019 as a means of silencing oppressed peoples,\u201d they explain. \u201cThe idea that there is a single truth\u2013\u2018the Truth\u2019\u2013is a construct of the Euro-West that is deeply rooted in the Enlightenment, which was a movement that also described Black and Brown people as both subhuman and impervious to pain. This construction is a myth and white supremacy, imperialism, colonization, capitalism, and the United States of America are all of its progeny. The idea that the truth is an entity for which we must search, in matters that endanger our abilities to exist in open spaces, is an attempt to silence oppressed peoples.\u201d\u000aIn reference to the protests of Mac Donald, the open letter explains that engaging with Mac Donald\u2019s speech would have amounted to a debate not \u201con mere difference of opinion, but [on] the right of Black people to exist.\u201d\u000a\u201cHeather Mac Donald is a fascist, a white supremacist, a warhawk, a transphobe, a queerphobe, a classist, and ignorant of interlocking systems of domination that produce the lethal conditions under which oppressed peoples are forced to live,\u201d the letter claims. \u201cWhy are you [President Oxtoby], and other persons in positions of power at these institutions, protecting a fascist and her hate speech and not students that are directly affected by her presence?\u201d\u000aThe open letter concludes by insisting that Oxtoby apologize for his April 7 email and issue a new message that the college \u201cdoes not tolerate hate speech and speech that projects violence onto the bodies of its marginalized students and oppressed peoples.\u201d\u000aThe students also demand that the Claremont Colleges \u201ctake action\u201d against the staff of the Claremont Independent for their \u201ccontinual perpetuation of hate speech, anti-Blackness, and intimidation toward students of marginalized backgrounds.\u201d Taking a step further, they call for \u201cdisciplinary action\u201d against conservative journalists from the Claremont Colleges.\u000a\u201cWe also demand that Pomona College and the Claremont University Consortium entities take action against the Claremont Independent editorial staff for its continual perpetuation of hate speech, anti-Blackness, and intimidation toward students of marginalized backgrounds,\u201d they write. \u201cProvided that the Claremont Independent releases the identity of students involved with this letter and such students begin to receive threats and hate mail, we demand that this institution and its constituents take legal action against members of the Claremont Independent involved with the editing and publication process as well as disciplinary action, such as expulsion on the grounds of endangering the wellbeing of others.\u201d \u000aThe letter\u2019s signatories, of whom there are more than 20 at the time of publication, request a response by the afternoon of April 18.\u000aThe authors of the letter did not immediately respond to the Independent\u2019s requests for comment.

aS'Citing \xe2\x80\x9cExploitation,\xe2\x80\x9d Scripps RAs Refuse to Work, Issue Demands'
p263
aVOn Thursday, Scripps College students employed as resident advisors (RAs) on campus announced that they will refuse to work in protest of their \u201cexploitation\u201d as \u201clow income students of color\u201d until their demands for extensive changes to college policies and personnel are met.\u000aThough acknowledging that failing to perform their supervisory duties would enable students to \u201cengage[] in unsafe behavior\u201d and deprive students of a valuable mental health resource, the resident advisors insisted in an open letter to Scripps President Lara Tiedens that the college\u2019s \u201cexploitation\u201d of their labor in the aftermath of the tragic death of a fellow Scripps student justified the drastic measures.\u000a\u201cWe are now expected to continue to function in our roles while also grieving and trying to fulfill academic and other responsibilities,\u201d the letter explained. \u201cFurthermore, most of us are low income students of color, which further exacerbates the exploitation we are experiencing.\u201d\u000aThe lengthy letter demands the \u201cimmediate resignation\u201d of the current Dean of Students for failing to \u201cshow adequate leadership or support,\u201d as well as significant changes to the college\u2019s mental health, residential life, and financial aid policies.\u000aCentral are the changes the RAs are seeking to their own role on campus. They charge that their central duties, such as performing walkthroughs and enforcing college policies on lockouts and room residency, do \u201cnot actually model restorative justice\u201d and hurt \u201cmarginalized students more than students with money and privilege.\u201d\u000a\u201cFor example, students are given two free lockouts per year, and after these free lockouts a student is fined $25 per lockout,\u201d they explain, referring to the college\u2019s policy on students who lock themselves out of their own rooms. \u201cRAs are expected to record these lockouts so if a student surpasses their number of free lockouts, they are charged; this is a classist practice that serves no concrete purpose.\u201d\u000aThe RAs also criticize the college\u2019s requirement that students exit residence halls at the conclusion of each semester or face a daily fine. \u201cCharging residents who stay past closing time for breaks is yet another classist practice that we are asked to implement,\u201d they complain. \u201cThis [policy] does not allow any consideration of individual personal circumstances that leave students with nowhere to go. These, and all other fines used to disproportionately punish students must be removed.\u201d\u000aTurning to mental health on campus, the RAs\u2019 letter demands that Scripps \u201cincrease the subsidy for off-campus therapy,\u201d saying that a \u201cfinancial burden should not be put on any student who seeks to improve their mental health.\u201d\u000aOn financial aid, the RAs insist that the college \u201callocate[] emergency funding to accommodate unexpected changes in student finances.\u201d They also propose a new financial aid formula that would permit students to obtain outside scholarships without reducing need-based aid granted by the college.\u000aThe labor \u201cstrike\u201d is total. The RAs say that they \u201cwill not perform any of the labor expected of us\u201d \u2014 including providing emotional support to students, responding to emergencies in the residence halls, and assisting students who are locked out of their rooms \u2014 unless the school agrees to meet their demands by April 20th.\u000aThe resident advisor position is one of the best-paying jobs available to students on campus at Scripps. Because RAs are important to ensuring student safety and protecting college property, Scripps College covers the full cost of room and board for all RAs \u2014 nearly $16,000 per year.

aS'Anti-Racism Protesters Segregated Themselves by Race'
p267
aVOn Thursday night, protesters descended upon the Marian Miner Cook Athenaeum at Claremont McKenna College (CMC) in order to prevent Heather Mac Donald, a political commentator and author, from giving a lecture scheduled for that night. The protesters were ultimately successful, as Mac Donald\u2019s speech was cut short.\u000aThe protest was organized on Facebook by a group called \u201cShutDown Anti-BlackFascists,\u201d and over 250 people\u2014including students at the Claremont Colleges, students at other colleges, and non-students\u2014attended. The Claremont Independent obtained a screen shot from the ShutDown Anti-BlackFascists group describing instructions for the protest.\u000aThe page states, \u201cFor white accomplices: Please keep in mind that your role at this protest, aside from acting in solidarity with POC students at the 5Cs, particularly Black students, is to serve as a buffer between students of color and the police. That means, if the police come, it is imperative that you stay at the protest with fellow accomplices and engage with cops should it come to that.\u201d Outside the Athenaeum, protest leaders shouted, \u201cWhite students to the front!\u201d\u000aShutDown Anti-BlackFascists also discouraged protesters from speaking with the media, stating, \u201cWe ask that participants do not engage with CI [Claremont Independent] reporters or anyone else who is trying to derail this action.\u201d When correspondents from the Independent, including this author, sought information from protesters, they were met with silence and often had hands, clothing, or signs pushed in their faces.\u000aThe instructions also describe an \u201caccomplice meeting\u201d at Scripps College where protesters can learn more information about how to handle themselves in various situations. \u201cThere is a high likelihood that campus security and police will be present,\u201d states the Facebook page. \u201c[S]o please attend the accomplice meeting at the Scripps Student Union today at 3:30 pm to act given that situation or one where counter protesting is taking place. It is very important that there are white bodies at the action \u2013 please show up yourself for the entire duration of the event or if not have friends who can be trusted to go in your place.\u201d

aS'CMC President Promises To Punish Policy Violators in Wake of Protest'
p271
aVAfter protesters at Claremont McKenna College shut down a scheduled lecture and Q&A with Heather Mac Donald, a critic of the Black Lives Matter movement, by blocking the venue\u2019s entrance, Hiram Chodosh, the president of Claremont McKenna College, promised to crack down on some student protesters for violating college policy.\u000aChodosh observed that, despite the protesters\u2019 efforts, a live-stream of Mac Donald\u2019s talk was viewed by nearly 250 people live and had been watched over 1,400 times at the time of his email. \u201cIn the end, the effort to silence her voice effectively amplified it to a much larger audience,\u201d he wrote.\u000aHe outlined the college\u2019s decision to not physically remove protesters, explaining that \u201cbased on the judgment of the Claremont Police Department, we [the college] jointly concluded that any forced interventions or arrests would have created unsafe conditions for students, faculty, staff, and guests.\u201d\u000aChodosh also took the unusual step of promising punishment for those who blocked all exits and entrances to the Marian Miner Cook Athenaeum, where Mac Donald\u2019s talk was scheduled to take place. \u201cBlocking access to buildings violates College policy,\u201d he wrote. \u201cCMC students who are found to have violated policies will be held accountable. We will also give a full report to the other Claremont Colleges, who have responsibility for their own students.\u201d\u000aChodosh highlighted the fact that the protest was composed of \u201ca large group of students from the Claremont Colleges, including a small number of CMC students and some individuals from external communities.\u201d\u000aEchoing the statement released Thursday evening by Vice President for Academic Affairs & Dean of Faculty at Claremont McKenna College, Peter Uvin, Chodosh concluded by reaffirming the college\u2019s commitment to protecting free speech:\u000a\u201cFinally, the breach of our freedoms to listen to views that challenge us and to engage in dialogue about matters of controversy is a serious, ongoing concern we must address effectively. Accordingly, we will be developing new strategies for how best to protect open, safe access to our events.\u201d\u000aShare this:Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)MoreClick to print (Opens in new window)Click to share on Pinterest (Opens in new window)Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)Click to share on Google+ (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Tags: Claremont McKenna College CMC Heather Mac Donald ProtestCategories: Campus News

aS'Protesters Shut Down BLM Critic, Threaten Student Journalists'
p275
aVOn Thursday, a raucous crowd of student protesters blocked the exits to Claremont McKenna College\u2019s Marian Miner Cook Athenaeum, shutting down a scheduled lecture and question-and-answer session by Heather Mac Donald, a prominent scholar and critic of the Black Lives Matter movement.\u000aChanting \u201cBlack lives matter here\u201d and \u201cno cops, no KKK, no fascist USA,\u201d protesters massed tightly around the exits, blocking fellow students from entering Mac Donald\u2019s scheduled presentation, entitled \u201cThe War on Police.\u201d Even faculty members who sought to enter the building were denied, with waves of protesters screaming and resorting to physical force to repel anyone who drew too close to the building. At one point, a crowd of White students screaming \u201cFuck White supremacy, fuck White supremacy\u201d pushed an elderly White professor away from the Athenaeum entrance.\u000aWhen the scheduled start time of Mac Donald\u2019s presentation came and then went, the crowds earned a half-victory: Students wishing to attend the event were unable to hear Mac Donald in person, though her presentation ultimately took place over a video livestream more than an hour behind schedule.\u000a\u201cStudent protesters have made it impossible for guests to enter the Athenaeum for the Heather McDonald talk this evening,\u201d wrote Peter Uvin, the Vice President for Academic Affairs & Dean of the Faculty at Claremont McKenna College, in a campus-wide email. \u201cIn the interest of safety, Heather McDonald\u2019s lecture will be livestreamed as close to 6:15 PM as possible.\u201d\u000aAfter Uvin\u2019s announcement, the protests continued to swell. Upon locating the source of the livestream, students stood outside the glass windows and screamed in the hopes of disrupting the presentation. They also gathered outside all the entrances and exits from the building, including the service entrances and fire escapes, to block anyone seeking to enter or exit and to trap the speaker inside.\u000aProtesters targeted observers and student journalists with their ire. White male students watching the chaos were ordered to leave, while journalists \u2014 including several from the Independent \u2014 found themselves surrounded by a mob seeking to block their coverage. One editor from the Independent reported receiving threats of physical violence for recording video at the scene, while another had to retreat to safety from the mob under the protection of a line of campus security officers.\u000aProtesters also confronted students taking photos on the outskirts of the gathering, demanding that they blur out every person in their photos of the public demonstration.\u000aCampus security was present during the protest, with anywhere from 10 to about 20 officers reportedly on the scene. Though typically unarmed, campus security officers appeared to be equipped with pepper spray in the event of a violent escalation. Despite several direct confrontations with protesters, who pressed forward into officers as they yelled \u201cfuck the police,\u201d the officers remained collected and professional, restraining the angry crowd without resorting to force.\u000aAt 7:05 pm Uvin released a statement to the Claremont McKenna community, which criticized the protest\u2019s methods:\u000a\u201cWhat we face here is not an attempt to demonstrate, or to ask tough questions of our speaker, all of which are protected and cherished on this campus, but rather to make it impossible for her to speak, for you to listen, and for all of us  to debate. This we could not accept.\u201d\u000aUvin went on to emphasize the importance of open discussion:\u000a\u201cQuestions about policing, police brutality, crime, and race matter a lot to our society. Yet precisely because these issues are so important, we must be able to debate them, to acknowledge that there exist different analyses and life experiences about these matters, and to listen carefully to each other.\u201d\u000aUvin ended the statement with a lengthy quote from the recent statement written by Princeton professors Cornel West and Robert George, including the following:\u000a\u201cIt is all-too-common these days for people to try to immunize from criticism opinions that happen to be dominant in their particular communities. Sometimes this is done by questioning the motives and thus stigmatizing those who dissent from prevailing opinions; or by disrupting their presentations; or by demanding that they be excluded from campus or, if they have already been invited, disinvited. Sometimes students and faculty members turn their backs on speakers whose opinions they don\u2019t like or simply walk out and refuse to listen to those whose convictions offend their values. Of course, the right to peacefully protest, including on campuses, is sacrosanct. But before exercising that right, each of us should ask: Might it not be better to listen respectfully and try to learn from a speaker with whom I disagree? Might it better serve the cause of truth-seeking to engage the speaker in frank civil discussion?\u201d\u000a \u000aThese statements have been adjusted since the story\u2019s initial publication to include Dean Uvin\u2019s statement.\u000a\u2014\u2014\u000aPhoto: Jenifer Hanki\u000aQuinn Clarke, Elliot Dordick, Will Gu, and Steven Glick contributed reporting.\u000aShare this:Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)MoreClick to print (Opens in new window)Click to share on Pinterest (Opens in new window)Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)Click to share on Google+ (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Categories: Campus News

Mac Donald, a member of the Manhattan Institute and a contributing editor of City Journal, is scheduled to give a speech at Claremont McKenna College\u2019s Marian Miner Cook Athenaeum.\u000aA photo of the students\u2019 call to protest.\u000aAccording to the event\u2019s description on the Athenaeum\u2019s website, \u201cThe Black Lives Matter movement holds that the U.S. is experiencing an epidemic of racially-driven police shootings, and that policing is shot through with systemic bias. Contending that the central Black Lives Matter narrative is not just false but dangerous, Heather Mac Donald will explore the data on policing, crime, and race and argue that policing today is driven by crime, not race, and that the movement has caused officers to back off of proactive policing in high crime areas, leading to the largest spike in nearly 50 years, disproportionately affecting blacks.\u201d\u000aStudent protestors plan to \u201cshut down\u201d the event. \u201cAnti-Black \u2018scholar\u2019 Heather Mac Donald has been invited to speak at Claremont McKenna College,\u201d states the protest\u2019s Facebook page. \u201cJoin the action with students of color at the Claremont Colleges to shut her down!!\u201d\u000aA Facebook event titled, \u201cShut Down Anti-Black Fascist Heather Mac Donald\u201d and hosted by \u201cShutDown Anti-BlackFascists\u201d encourages students to protest the event because Mac Donald \u201ccondemns [the] Black Lives Matter movement,\u201d \u201csupports racist police officers,\u201d and \u201csupports increasing fascist \u2018law and order.\u2019\u201d

aS'DACA On College Campuses'
p283
aVJust under five years ago, on the thirtieth anniversary of Plyler v. Doe, then-president Barack Obama put forth an executive order that created the immigration policy known as Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA). In higher education, this policy has conferred many benefits upon certain undocumented residents of the U.S., including limited protection from immigration officers and access to public and private financial aid packages. \u000aDACA grants immigrants a two-year grace period during which they are treated as temporary residents and are eligible for work permits. The policy is only available to those who (a) came into the United States before their sixteenth birthday before June 2007; (b) are currently in school, are a high school graduate, or have been honorably discharged from the military; (c) were born after June 15, 1981; and (d) are not a threat to American security.\u000aThose granted DACA status have no path to citizenship, yet they still can receive a number of benefits normally exclusive to legal permanent residents of the U.S. These benefits include being able to obtain a driver\u2019s license in all fifty states, having an \u2018exempt non-citizen\u2019 status that absolves them from the fines for not having insurance under the Affordable Care Act\u2019s individual mandate, being granted special tax refunds and credits, and being able to obtain temporary social security numbers.\u000aThe benefits of DACA for its grantees, however, go far beyond these basics and extend deeply into the American higher education system. In twenty states, DACA immigrants are allowed to register for public community colleges, colleges, and universities with an in-state resident status, which halves their tuition costs in many circumstances. In six states, they qualify for state-funded financial aid packages for public colleges and universities. On top of any state-sponsored financial aid packages for which DACA grantees qualify, there are many private scholarships and grants available. States like Utah offer private funding through public universities to their DACA students.\u000aSome private colleges such as Amherst College and Columbia University offer the same need-blind admission policy to both domestic and non-citizen applicants alike. Others, such as Pomona College, a member of the Claremont Consortium, go further and do not differentiate between documented and undocumented applicants for either admissions or financial aid. Pitzer College and Scripps College, also members of the Claremont Consortium, each offer full, renewable grants for one undocumented first-year student per year. Scripps also recently announced they will follow Pomona\u2019s example and will begin extending need-based financial aid to all undocumented students, regardless of their DACA status, next fall. Meanwhile, at the other Claremont Colleges, Claremont McKenna College and Harvey Mudd College, undocumented students must apply for external scholarships such as the Cal Grant if they require financial assistance, though at Harvey Mudd, they are encouraged to apply for international student financial aid.\u000aOnce DACA students have graduated from their respective undergraduate institutions, state law determines the opportunities available to them. In California, for instance, DACA students may acquire licenses to practice law, medicine, nursing, and pharmacy; can study abroad; and, for the University of California postgraduate programs, they are eligible for all financial aid, grants, and fellowships applicable to U.S. citizens.\u000aNonetheless, even with all of the benefits of the DACA program, DACA students still fear that their information might be passed along to federal immigration officers. While all DACA immigrants\u2019 information has been shared with the Department of Homeland Security, ICE may not access this information at this time. Many DACA students fear that this could change under President Trump. In response to these anxieties, DACA students and their allies have advocated that colleges become \u2018sanctuary campuses.\u2019 Like sanctuary cities, they would protect the local undocumented community from deportation and arrest by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officers.\u000aUnfortunately for DACA students, neither of these sanctuary environments have any real legal force, as ICE can still conduct raids on a sanctuary campus. The most that these sanctuary communities and immigration activists can do is to refuse to share information with ICE, to hand over undocumented immigrants, or to coordinate with local police as they attempt to assist ICE. Given that ICE only has around five thousand agents, help from local police departments is necessary for successful ICE operations.\u000aEven within the five-college Claremont Consortium, the magnitude of each school\u2019s efforts greatly differ. Pomona\u2019s president David W. Oxtoby acknowledges that calling the college a \u2018sanctuary campus\u2019 is not entirely accurate as Pomona cannot offer either literal sanctuary or legal authority in protecting its students; yet, of the five colleges\u2014arguably of virtually all liberal arts colleges\u2014Pomona offers the greatest amount of aid and support to its estimated fifty to sixty undocumented students. Pitzer and Scripps, on the other hand, have declared themselves to be sanctuary colleges, but the services designated for their undocumented students are much more limited than those of Pomona. Harvey Mudd and Claremont McKenna put even less resources toward supporting their undocumented students, have not changed their nondiscrimination policies to the extent which Scripps and Pomona have, and neither institution has come forward offering to help these students find legal aid if needed.\u000aColleges have been eager to throw public support behind their undocumented students, as evidenced by strong support for DACA among college presidents. All five presidents of Claremont\u2019s undergraduate institutions, along with the presidents of 634 other institutions, signed a letter put forth by President Oxtoby that DACA should not only be sustained, but should also be expanded. Calling DACA\u2019s expansion a \u201cmoral imperative\u201d and a \u201cnational necessity,\u201d President Oxtoby goes on to state that undocumented students \u201crepresent what is best about America.\u201d\u000aNot all college administrators, even those who signed it, are completely on board with the progressive sentiments President Oxtoby expresses in the letter. Claremont McKenna\u2019s president Hiram Chodosh wrote to the CMC community, \u201cI believe that the Statement\u2019s specific advocacy for DACA may \u2026 compromise non-partisan values vital to higher education.\u201d All five schools, however, including Claremont McKenna, have promised to offer counseling resources to their undocumented students and to require that Claremont College Campus Security officers not ask students to disclose their citizenship status.\u000aShare this:Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)MoreClick to print (Opens in new window)Click to share on Pinterest (Opens in new window)Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)Click to share on Google+ (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Tags: Claremont Consortium Claremont McKenna College CMC DACA harvey mudd college Pitzer College pomona college Scripps CollegeCategories: Feature

aVScripps students boycotted Scripps College\u2019s Malott Dining Hall during lunch on Thursday in order to protest Scripps\u2019 contract with its dining hall provider Sodexo, accusing Sodexo of racism, exploitation of labor, environmental violations, and management of private prisons. Organized by Scripps student campaign Drop Sodexo, the boycott as well as a simultaneous protest outside the dining hall were aimed at ending Scripps\u2019 contract with Sodexo. Drop Sodexo urged students to eat at other dining halls in the Claremont University Consortium (CUC) during the boycott.\u000aAccording to the event description, the organizers invited students to \u201cjoin the Drop Sodexo campain [sic] in protesting Scripps\u2019 contract with Sodexo! This is a boycott of Malott lunch services on the 30th as well as an alternative community lunch event. We want to show the administration that students are serious about ending the Sodexo contract. You showing up to this event will help do that!\u201d Following the boycott, Drop Sodexo claimed success, writing that \u201cMalott was basically empty for all of lunch.\u201d\u000aThe Drop Sodexo campaign organized the boycott because it claims Sodexo\u2014a French multinational\u2014is involved in \u201ccivil rights abuses\u2026neoliberalism, anti-unionism, substandard food quality\u2026racial discrimination, major class-action lawsuits, ownership of private prisons, and much more.\u201d The students also claim that Sodexo exploits \u201cneocolonial relationships that allow them to acquire raw materials from nations of the Global South.\u201d Drop Sodexo also states that by \u201ccontinuing business with a company that has such an extensive corporate crime record, we [Scripps] are providing a monetary endorsement for the increasing exploitation of land, people, and communities throughout the world.\u201d\u000aIn an interview with The Student Life\u2014the administration-funded student newspaper of the Claremont Colleges \u2013student organizer Rebecca Millberg (SC \u201917) accuses Sodexo of having \u201ca history of horrible labor practices and food safety violations and worker exploitation,\u201d adding that \u201cit shouldn\u2019t be hard for Scripps administration to see that it [the contract with Sodexo] goes completely against our values.\u201d\u000aScripps administration subsequently informed student organizers that terminating Sodexo\u2019s contract before its 2020 expiration could result in over $1 million in \u201clegal fees and a variety of other expenses\u201d that could \u201creduce funding for other important priorities, such as financial aid and faculty and staff compensation.\u201d In a separate statement in response to students\u2019 calls to end its contract with Sodexo, Scripps administrators stated that \u201cthe College does not have a policy of disqualifying contractors based on their client or investment portfolio.\u201d\u000aDrop Sodexo has suggested that \u201cScripps could choose any number of dining management companies besides Sodexo,\u201d including in-house dining services. But when Pomona College \u2014 the flagship institution of the CUC \u2014 stopped contracting with Sodexo in 2011, many dining hall staff lost their positions at the College.\u000aIt doesn\u2019t help that many of Drop Sodexo\u2019s accusations run counter to Sodexo\u2019s actual track record.\u000aWhile Sodexo did settle an $80 million lawsuit brought by black employees on the basis of workplace discrimination back in 2005, it has since won numerous awards for diversity and inclusivity, including NBIC\u2019s \u201c2016 Best of the Best Corporation for Inclusion,\u201d DiversityInc\u2019s \u201c2016 Top 50 Companies for Diversity,\u201d and Working Mother\u2019s \u201cBest Companies for Multicultural Women.\u201d The French multinational has also recently received awards for sustainability, its commitment to hiring and retaining military veterans, and LGBT inclusion in its workforce.\u000aDrop Sodexo also charges that Sodexo has \u201ca consistent pattern of interfering with worker rights in many states,\u201d and it has criticized the company\u2019s \u201canti-unionism\u201d actions against the Service Employees International Union (SEIU). In fact, Sodexo took the SEIU to court for employing illegal tactics to unionize workers, including blackmail and extortion. Faced with the possibility of a highly damaging public relations fiasco and civil liabilities, the SEIU agreed to terminate protests against Sodexo in exchange for dropped charges.\u000aThe student campaigners have also criticized Sodexo\u2019s food quality and safety, stating that \u201cto avoid having allergic reactions, many students limit themselves to eating the same foods for each meal because the labeling cannot be trusted.\u201d Malott has been rated as one of the best campus dining halls in the country by the Princeton Review.\u000aAccording to Drop Sodexo, the French multinational is responsible for the \u201cprivatization of the prison industry\u201d and has exploited \u201cunpaid or underpaid labor from private prisons.\u201d While Sodexo divested its investments from American private prison corporation Correction Corporation of America in 2001 \u2014 nearly two decades ago \u2014 charges that Sodexo has poorly managed private prisons abroad are substantiated, as evidenced by the Sodexo-managed prisons HMP Northumberland and HMP Forest Bank in the United Kingdom.\u000aSodexo has operations in developing countries such has Colombia, Guinea, Morocco, and the Dominican Republic.\u000aDrop Sodexo did not

p291
aVStudents from the women\u2019s-only Scripps College are petitioning Pomona College administrators in an effort to enlarge the Gender Women Studies (GWS) program at Pomona, the flagship institution of the Claremont University Consortium.\u000aOrganized by a Scripps first-year, a petition urging Pomona College to devote more resources to Gender Women Studies has already gained significant traction, having obtained its goal of one hundred signatures last Thursday. It demands that Pomona \u201chire full time professors for the Gender Women\u2019s Studies Program\u201d and \u201c[make] a larger commitment to Gender Women\u2019s Studies to \u201csupport women, trans people, non-binary people, and intersectional feminism.\u201d According to Pomona\u2019s website, Gender Women\u2019s Studies at Pomona College focuses on \u201cthe intersection of gender with race, sexuality, class and colonialism.\u201d\u000aAnother Scripps student, Tiara Sharma, boosted the petition in an opinion editorial for The Student Life, the Claremont Colleges\u2019 administration-funded student newspaper. Titling her piece \u201cPomona Needs a Real Gender and Women\u2019s Studies Department,\u201d she advertises the petition and affirms its message. Pomona College, she argues, with its vastly larger endowment in comparison with those of the other Claremont Colleges, has \u201cthe responsibility to provide students [of the Claremont Colleges] with academic opportunities that they are entitled to,\u201d criticizing what she sees as Pomona\u2019s failure \u201cto fulfill this responsibility in regards to its Gender and Women\u2019s Studies program.\u201d\u000aSharma\u2014who plans to major in English and \u201cmaybe Philosophy\u201d\u2014also complains that the GWS program is not getting \u201cthe same resources allocated to similar departments such as Politics, Media Studies, or History.\u201d To this point, she claims that \u201cPomona has not given its Gender Women\u2019s Studies program department distinction,\u201d as it has \u201conly one full-time professor devoted solely to GWS.\u201d And \u201cas Trump and his administration continue to undermine the right of many marginalized identities,\u201d she continues, a strong GWS program is more important than ever.\u000aSigners of the petition echoed Sharma\u2019s sentiments. One signee explains that she signed the petition \u201cbecause [GWS is] just as important, if not more [under our] current president, as every other major.\u201d\u000aAccording to statistics released by the College, however, GWS is one of the most unpopular majors at Pomona College, averaging at a little over two majors per class in the last five years. By contrast, over the same period, nearly 46 students have majored in economics, one of the school\u2019s more popular majors, each year. Also, according to PayScale, GWS majors make an average salary of $39,000, considerably less than the average starting salary of undergraduates\u2014$50,556, as Time reports.\u000aOther students have disputed the petition on different grounds. Matthew Ludlam (PO \u201920) told the Independent in a message that \u201cthe problem is that this student [the creator of the petition] is under the impression that all colleges should operate similarly \u2026 To assume that all colleges need a department that does not forward the goals integral to the college is preposterous,\u201d referring to how Pomona College, as a co-ed institution, has different goals than a women\u2019s-only college like Scripps.\u000aThe administration of Pomona College has yet to respond to the petition.\u000aShare this:Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)MoreClick to print (Opens in new window)Click to share on Pinterest (Opens in new window)Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)Click to share on Google+ (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Categories: Campus News

aVOn March 9, Pitzer College President Melvin Oliver released a presidential \u201cMessage to the Community\u201d titled \u201cHate Speech is Not Free Speech\u201d which was both posted on the College\u2019s website and sent in an email thread to all students, faculty, and staff at Pitzer.\u000aThe public statement, a response to the article published by The Claremont Independent that sparked national conversation on PC culture, racism, and cultural appropriation on campus, reads:\u000a\u201cDear Pitzer College Community, Coverage in a local publication of a recent posting on the free wall [by Latino students that instructed white women to \u2018take off their hoop earrings\u2019] has ignited a cycle of violent hate speech that threatens the safety and well-being of every member of our community. Some students are experiencing harassment and death threats. As a place of higher education, we strongly cherish and defend intellectual curiosity, productive discourse and opposing views that may broaden our perspectives as global citizens.\u000aHowever, when speech resorts to hate, violence and threats, we will not tolerate these acts nor the perpetrators of these actions. If you have information that will help us bring those responsible to justice, please contact the Office of Student Affairs and the Claremont Police Department. Every individual is entitled to freedom from fear and stigma, and with the respect of others to pursue a life of meaning and purpose. Pitzer College supports greater acceptance, not less. However each of us chooses to respond to the challenges presented by these ill-considered, offensive and hateful actions, I encourage us to care for one another and focus on our shared positive values.\u201d\u000aIn the rest of his message, Oliver encourages students, staff and faculty to participate in a \u201cHealing Justice Workshop\u201d hosted by Pitzer Professor Kathy Yep. \u201cThe workshop,\u201d Oliver writes, \u201cpractices mindfulness in a way that creates a more just, peaceful, and sustainable world and does not cause harm to others.\u201d\u000aThe statement closes by listing resources for psychological counseling, Black Student Affairs, Chicano Latino Student Affairs, the Chaplain\u2019s office, the Queer Resource Center, the Office of the Dean of Faculty, and the Office of Student Affairs available for support on campus at the Claremont Colleges.

aS'Inside the College #Resistance'
p299
aVLast month, at an event at Scripps College intended to educate students on activism, I learned the art of \u201csolidarity\u201d\u2014helping undocumented immigrants circumvent our nation\u2019s immigration laws, and collectively shouting down opponents in student-led political protests.\u000aEver since the inauguration of Donald Trump as president of the United States, protests of his administration and other acts of resistance seem to be happening everywhere and every day, from the streets to the town hall meetings of members of Congress. Participation by my fellow college students in the \u201canti-fascist resistance\u201d (or, in millennial speak, \u201canti-fascist #resistance\u201d) is the norm, yet I had been puzzled as to how my peers planned to resist and what exactly the #resistance entails.\u000aI finally had the opportunity to find out when I attended the event held by the #resistance at Scripps College with the purpose of teaching the students of the Claremont Colleges how to \u201cresist the fascist and white supremacist policies being espoused and enacted by our current administration\u201d by \u201c[roleplaying] solidarity actions.\u201d Walking in, I only had two questions that I hoped would be answered: Will the methods of resistance taught be legal, and how is this current administration fascist? I hoped that the former would be answered affirmatively, and that someone would at least attempt to explain the latter to me.\u000aThe event began with a discussion led by representatives from the labor union UNITE HERE, who explained that they hoped to teach students about the rights guaranteed by our country\u2019s rule of law. Besides the gimmicky antics of the speakers, who called each other \u201ccomrade\u201d and urged \u201cstudents and [the] community to fight capitalism\u201d in one of their PowerPoint slides, the opening discussion addressed the Trump administration\u2019s deportation of undocumented immigrants and the legal rights of undocumented immigrants in a substantive way. The speakers explained, for example, the differences between administrative and judicial warrants, clarifying that only judicial warrants give Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents the authority to search private homes for undocumented individuals, and detailed the legal processes that undocumented immigrants face if arrested.\u000aBut this substantive discussion, which lifted my hopes, soon gave way to silliness\u2014the roleplay simulation of ICE arrests, as well as a crash course on how to disrupt and protest in the streets and in the offices of politicians.\u000aTo simulate an ICE arrest, some participants (mainly students) were given roles as suspected undocumented immigrants; others were assigned to be ICE agents. When questioned by the ostensible ICE agents, the students who played suspected undocumented immigrants were instructed to pretend to be undocumented\u2014staying silent in the face of ICE commands. This method saddened me; to set a precedent of undermining our rule of law is dangerous, and to expect the people of our country to buy into obstructing law enforcement belittles the decency and respect for the law Americans have. The organizers called this tactic \u201csolidarity\u201d; by pretending to not have documents, citizens and documented immigrants can make it difficult for immigration agents to find the undocumented individuals among them. However, teaching a group of presumably documented students who are mostly citizens how to pretend to be undocumented to show \u201csolidarity\u201d does not seem likely to solve the problems of illegal immigration. The change in content, from explaining the American legal system to obstructing the rule of law, struck me as another example of the organizers\u2019 unconstructive message\u2014teaching students how to hinder the rule of law should not be the answer to perceived injustices\u2014but this message did not end here; the speakers soon started criticizing dialogue, touting uninterrupted protest as a better alternative.\u000aChanging course, the speakers moved to discuss how protests trump dialogue as effective and just means of resisting the Trump administration, even if they block the flow of traffic and affect local businesses. To help students understand how to protest effectively as a \u201cdelegation,\u201d the organizers initiated another roleplay scenario. I was assigned to be a member of the \u201cherd,\u201d the backbone of the delegation the role of which is to project numerical superiority. Some students played the role of \u201cspeakers,\u201d who deliver the group\u2019s message to a \u201cperson of power,\u201d and others played \u201cmonitors\u201d and \u201cherders,\u201d who are supposed to keep the delegation together and lead chants whenever the speakers encounter any trouble, which the organizers defined as any attempt to interrupt the speakers from delivering their message, even if it was an offer for constructive dialogue. I was hopeful that my peers would not believe suppressing dialogue is a solution to their perceived problems, but their enthusiasm proved me wrong. Their enthusiasm discouraged me; dialogue, the very foundation of communicating and solving problems with people of different opinions, seems to be shunned now. We simulated storming into a politician\u2019s office and delivering a message, with the monitors leading a zealous chant of \u201cLet them speak!\u201d whenever the speakers were challenged by drowning out any voices of opposition.\u000aAfter the event ended, I could not help but feel disheartened. Despite the commendable determination my radical peers displayed, it seemed they were willing to shut out dialogue to \u201cdeliver their message,\u201d avoid confronting any challenge to their ideas by simply drowning out opposition with chants, and obstruct the rule of law that has served our nation so well. They were willing to divide and label this nation which we all share into groups of \u201coppressors\u201d and \u201cresistors,\u201d all in an effort to challenge our democratically elected, though apparently \u201cfascist\u201d administration.\u000aAfter almost two hours of indoctrination and \u201croleplaying oppression,\u201d I left discouraged with my fellow students\u2019 radical methods and misconceived ideas about the state of America\u2014summarized by a souvenir in the form of a pledge card asking me to \u201cfight back against the fascist policies of this new administration\u201d and \u201cengage in non violent civil disobedience.\u201d However, most importantly, even after those two hours, I still did not have an answer to one of my central questions: \u201cHow is this current administration fascist?\u201d\u000a______________\u000aImage: Flickr\u000aShare this:Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)MoreClick to print (Opens in new window)Click to share on Pinterest (Opens in new window)Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)Click to share on Google+ (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Tags: Protests Resistance Scripps CollegeCategories: Opinion

aS'Pitzer College RA: White People Can\xe2\x80\x99t Wear Hoop Earrings'
p303
aVA wall on the side of a dormitory at Pitzer College devoted to unmoderated free speech through art (colloquially named \u201cthe free wall\u201d), was recently painted by a group of Latino students who wrote the message, \u201cWhite Girl, take off your [hoop earrings]!!!\u201d\u000aWhen one white student expressed confusion about the message, Alegria Martinez (PZ \u201918) \u2013 a Pitzer College Resident Assistant (RA) and active member of the \u201cLatinx Student Union\u201d \u2013 responded in an email thread sent to the entire student body: \u201c[T]he art was created by myself and a few other WOC [women of color] after being tired and annoyed with the reoccuring [sic] theme of white women appropriating styles \u2026 that belong to the black and brown folks who created the culture. The culture actually comes from a historical background of oppression and exclusion. The black and brown bodies who typically wear hooped earrings, (and other accessories like winged eyeliner, gold name plate necklaces, etc) are typically viewed as ghetto, and are not taken seriously by others in their daily lives. Because of this, I see our winged eyeliner, lined lips, and big hoop earrings serving as symbols [and] as an everyday act of resistance, especially here at the Claremont Colleges. Meanwhile we wonder, why should white girls be able to take part in this culture (wearing hoop earrings just being one case of it) and be seen as cute/aesthetic/ethnic. White people have actually exploited the culture and made it into fashion.\u201d\u000aJacquelyn Aguilera (PZ \u201919), another student claiming credit for the spray-painted message, responded to the school-wide email thread, \u201cIf you didn\u2019t create the culture as a coping mechanism for marginalization, take off those hoops, if your feminism isn\u2019t intersectional take off those hoops, if you try to wear mi cultura when the creators can no longer afford it, take off those hoops, if you are incapable of using a search engine and expect other people to educate you, take off those hoops, if you can\u2019t pronounce my name or spell it \u2026 take off those hoops / I use \u201cthose\u201d instead of \u201cyour\u201d because hoops were never \u201cyours\u201d to begin with.\u201d Aguilera attached an image of herself and the others who spray-painted the wall exposing their own hoop earrings.\u000aPitzer\u2019s website states that on the free wall  \u201cyou\u2019ll find artistic representation of local and global issues that usually spark educational discussion across campus!\u201d\u000aMartinez and Aguilera declined the Independent\u2018s requests to elaborate on their comments.\u000a_______________________\u000aPhoto: Elliot Dordick\u000aShare this:Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)MoreClick to print (Opens in new window)Click to share on Pinterest (Opens in new window)Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)Click to share on Google+ (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Tags: Cultural Appropriation Microaggression Pitzer CollegeCategories: Campus News

aS'Scripps College: Nonwhite Students Should Be Paid For Sharing Their Opinions'
p307
aVScripps College resident assistants (RAs) recently hung two types of signs titled \u201cEmotional Labor 101\u201d across campus. One of the signs, printed on a white background, is titled, \u201cQuick Guide For White Students.\u201d The other poster, printed on black paper, is titled, \u201cQuick Guide For People Of Color And Marginalized Backgrounds.\u201d\u000aBoth signs, which are marked with the Scripps College administration\u2019s stamp of approval, define \u201cemotional labor\u201d as \u201cthe exertion of energy for the purpose of addressing people\u2019s feelings, educating, making people comfortable, or living up to social \u2018expectations.\u2019\u201d  The sign addressing non-white students notes, \u201cVictims of emotional labor can be cornered in the classrooms, on social media, or in social events. If you are constantly having to explain or defend this could be you.\u201d The poster then asks, \u201cWhat can I do about it?\u201d and states, \u201cFirst and Foremost: Take care of yourself. Decide if it\u2019s worth your time. The burden does not rest on your shoulders! Remove yourself if possible/necessary. You don\u2019t owe anyone anything at the expense of your mental health. / Second: If you do decide to engage, practice some of these tips to avoid overexertion for the sake of educating: Refer to a friendly Google search of the concept in question; Call in professors and white peers to help educate their peer(s); Charge for your services. If you\u2019ve decided you\u2019re going to do it, at least get paid; Visit your designated [dean of students on campus] to talk about ways to address the mental toll.\u201d\u000aThe guide addressed to white students, rather than discussing the ways one can undergo \u201cemotional labor,\u201d asks \u201cHow do I know I\u2019m causing someone emotional labor? Ask yourself these questions: Could I have Googled the answer but I chose not to? Do I find myself in a situation where people of color or people from a marginalized group are educating me? What power dynamics are at play? Do I find myself getting defensive? Are people telling me I\u2019m causing them emotional labor?\u201d The message to white students ends by listing options for \u201cWhat can I do about [causing others emotional labor]?\u201d The poster states that white students should \u201cBe mindful of your place and position. Google it! Seek community of white people who are educating themselves/thinking about social justice issues. Compensate the labor you caused. Educate yourself, take advantage of ethnic studies courses, the internet, and SCORE [Scripps Communities of Resources and Empowerment] . Take ownership for the harm you caused. Do better next time!\u201d\u000aNeither the Scripps College nor the RAs whose email addresses are listed on the posters responded to requests for comment.\u000a___________________\u000aImage: Olivia Wu\u000aShare this:Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)MoreClick to print (Opens in new window)Click to share on Pinterest (Opens in new window)Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)Click to share on Google+ (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Categories: Campus News

aS'In Defense of the CMC Government Department'
p311
aV On January 30, the Forum, the official campus news bulletin of Claremont McKenna College (CMC), published an article criticizing the government department at CMC for lacking a sufficiently diverse body of professors. \u201cIn particular, students at CMC have voiced concerns about the problems with the program\u2019s practical applicability and diversity, both in the composition of the faculty and in the courses offered,\u201d the article states, going on to cite the department\u2019s \u201chomogeneity\u201d as one of the main reasons for the school\u2019s decade-long decline in the share of students majoring in government.\u000aIn reality, a lack of diversity (or a perceived lack thereof) is almost certainly not to blame for declining enrollment in government courses at CMC. In fact, the government faculty\u2019s intellectual diversity is an enduring strength found at very few other American educational institutions. Declining interest in fields like government and the humanities more likely reflects a general trend of students looking to gain a more practical skill set in college, one that will serve them well in the job market. This trend also helps explain the increasing interest in STEM, economics, and other career-oriented fields of study.\u000aBut even if we put these facts aside, the accusation that the department lacks meaningful diversity is false. The diversity that matters in an academic setting is that of opinion, and by this measure, CMC\u2019s government department is one of the most diverse in the nation. Learning the historical and ideological contexts of political systems and schools of thought, from a range of viewpoints, is fundamental in order to analyze and predict political trends with any degree of competency.\u000aWhat the department may lack is the surface-level brand of diversity that is so uniformly and falsely peddled by campus leftists as being the only legitimate kind. Despite the merits of the faculty, the Forum reports that students are primarily concerned by one thing: \u201cthe biggest downside of the department\u2026has been that the professors tend to be primarily white men.\u201d But the fact remains that we came to college to learn, and learning is not contingent upon the skin color or gender of our professors. Assessing the value of what someone has to say based on his/her appearance or cultural background betrays shallowness at best and bigotry at worst.\u000aEducation is about people\u2019s minds, not their ethnicities. And as the Forum article admits, one of the most impressive facets of the CMC government department is the impressive caliber of its individual members. Professor Charles Kesler, who is the editor of the Claremont Review of Books, published what turned out to be perhaps the single most influential conservative essay of the entire 2016 election cycle, \u201cThe Flight 93 Election.\u201d Yet, the Forum labels the majority of the department as \u201cproducts of times with different priorities,\u201d flippantly dismissing the knowledge of these professors and their willingness to share it.\u000a The range of views within the government department\u2014from liberal to conservative and everything in between\u2014is undoubtedly an asset to the department, as department chair Andrew Busch has said, and it is one of the main reasons the program and major gained national prominence in the first place. CMC\u2019s government major has long been lauded as one of the few in the country where students are able to learn about liberal and conservative ideology and political movements from several distinct perspectives. An academic department that imparts ideological positions from all across the political spectrum is rare and useful, and should be protected. \u000a At this moment, it is more important than ever for students to familiarize themselves with conservative ideas. The November election swept Republican politicians to power at the local, state, and federal levels. Knowing something about the foundational values of the Right will be especially valuable over the next few years to those who wish to work in real world politics. In this pivotal moment, it is strange to ask one of the nation\u2019s premier government departments to become more like all of the rest in order to regain its unique excellence. \u000a Making significant structural changes to the government department and its hiring practices in order to satisfy a superficial vision of diversity would diminish the merit of the department and the quality of the major. An academic department must hire professors based solely on their credentials, achievements, and abilities in order to provide students with the best faculty available. The Forum is wrong: the age, race, and gender of the present government faculty says nothing of their capacity to educate students in the fine art of politics.

aS'Pomona Students Can Change Gender Pronouns After Student Portal Update'
p315
aVOn Monday morning, an update to the Pomona College online student portal added a new feature called \u201cHelp Faculty learn your Pronoun,\u201d allowing students to submit or change their preferred gender pronouns in the student directory and other student records maintained by the Registrar.\u000aBesides the binary gender pronouns (He, Him, His, Himself and She, Her, Hers, Herself), the new feature includes the following gender pronouns in a drop-down list for students to submit to the Registrar: \u201cE/Ey, Em, Eir/Eirs, Eirself/Emse,\u201d \u201cHu, Hum, Hus, Humself,\u201d \u201cPer, Per, Per/Pers, Perself,\u201d \u201cZe, Hir, Hir/Hirs, Hirself,\u201d and \u201cZe, Zir, Zir/Zirs, Zirself.\u201d\u000aAfter submitting a gender pronoun change, students\u2019 preferred pronouns will appear with their names in the student directory, faculty class lists, and the advisee rosters of faculty advisors. According to the online instructions for the new feature, \u201ca Pronoun, is simply what an individual would like others to use when talking to or about that individual. Submitting your pronoun will help Faculty in learning your pronoun and support the proper use when talking to or about you.\u201d\u000aThe new interface for changing gender pronouns on the Pomona College student portal. (Click for larger version)\u000aIn a message to the Independent, Pomona College\u2019s Information Technology Services (ITS), which maintains and updates the student portal, stated that it was informed of the decision to implement the update in the fall semester of the school year by \u201cstudents through ASPC [The Associated Students of Pomona College], Student Affairs and the Queer Resource Center (QRC),\u201d \u201cafter a discussion with the office of Student Affairs and ASPC.\u201d\u000aFor its part, the ASPC hinted at the changes to the student portal last fall, when student government officials circulated a survey evaluating the need \u201cfor modifications to the Portal that would allow students to change their pronouns and/or name.\u201d\u000aRepresentatives from ASPC\u2014the College\u2019s student government\u2014gave the Independent the following statement concerning the student portal changes:\u000a\u201cASPC worked closely with the Office of the Registrar, the Dean of Students Office, and the Queer Resource Center (QRC) to develop a more efficient and user-friendly system for students wishing to change their gender pronouns and/or chosen name. ASPC and the relevant administrators independently identified the need for a Portal feature to facilitate these changes, and ASPC was asked to assist in the creation of the new feature to ensure that student voices were present in the conversation. Supporting transgender and non-binary students is of utmost importance to ASPC, and we sought their input throughout this process with the assistance of the QRC. We are allied with all marginalized communities and strive to be cognizant of their needs as we advocate for the student body in collaboration with the administration.\u201d\u000aIn particular, \u201cthe current Student Information System (SIS) makes it difficult to synchronize name and pronoun changes seamlessly in all relevant locations.\u201d In transitioning to a new SIS, the registrar\u2019s office and ITS, with the full support of the ASPC, has declared that having \u201ca mechanism that allows for global implementation of name and pronoun changes\u201d is \u201cnon-negotiable,\u201d as the new SIS must be \u201cmore conducive to supporting the transgender and non-binary community.\u201d\u000aIn a follow-up email to the Independent, ASPC added that \u201csome faculty, including members of the relevant faculty committee, the Student Affairs Committee, were consulted during the process.\u201d\u000aShare this:Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)MoreClick to print (Opens in new window)Click to share on Pinterest (Opens in new window)Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)Click to share on Google+ (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Categories: Campus News

We call into question the swiftness with which Scripps College responds to speech that challenges systematically privileged identities, and we challenge the community to think critically about what speech makes them feel uncomfortable versus unsafe. We want the students who wrote these statements to know that their perspectives are valued in this space and that we will continue to resist Scripps\u2019s effort to silence these perspectives in public spaces such as The Motley. / We recognize that erasing this board works to reinforce systems of power and oppression, and therefore we will not let this be where we let the story end.

aVEarlier this week, presidents of the five Claremont Colleges joined over thirty peer institutions of higher education in denouncing President Trump\u2019s recent executive order, which halts refugee immigration from Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria, and Yemen for 90 days. Trump stated of the executive order, \u201cAmerica is a proud nation of immigrants and we will continue to show compassion to those fleeing oppression, but we will do so while protecting our own citizens and border \u2026 The seven countries named in the Executive Order are the same countries previously identified by the Obama administration as sources of terror.\u201d However, the presidents\u2019 emails to their respective student bodies described Trump\u2019s policy as a ban on Muslim immigration.\u000aPomona College President David Oxtoby, for example, described Trump\u2019s orders as \u201cdeeply troubling\u201d examples of \u201cxenophobia\u201d and \u201creligious discrimination.\u201d President Oxtoby stated that \u201cthese actions tear at the fabric of who we are and what we aspire to be.\u201d Pitzer College President Melvin Oliver went so far as to say that \u201cPresident Trump has altered the American experience, and with it the vision of hope and unity previously shared by most of us.\u201d\u000aPresident Oliver\u2019s statement continues, \u201cthree executive orders \u2026 have upended our policies of openness and welcoming,\u201d claiming that the orders have \u201cthe practical effect of creating a religious ban against people of Muslim faith.\u201d Though Trump\u2019s orders would likely affect only around 200 million of over 1.5 billion Muslims worldwide, President Oliver told the Independent that he believes \u201cAmerica is more beautiful because of its inclusiveness, not despite it.\u201d Oliver stated that \u201cxenophobia \u2013 whether targeted at one \u2026 or 1.5 billion \u2013 goes against America\u2019s founding values,\u201d but did not specify why he thinks Trump\u2019s orders amount to a Muslim ban or what about them is xenophobic.\u000aWhile noting that Pitzer College, Claremont McKenna College, and Pomona College currently enroll zero students from the seven countries named in the executive order, each of the school presidents made lengthy efforts to reiterate the availability of emotional assistance for students who \u201cfeel vulnerable.\u201d President Lara Tiedens of Scripps College ended her own note by stating \u201cWe are fortunate to have such a strong network of active, informed, and compassionate individuals who are invested in preserving Scripps as a haven for inclusive excellence,\u201d referencing a December statement naming Scripps \u201ca sanctuary center of higher education\u201d which would follow in the footsteps of Pomona College and Pitzer College to refuse compliance with federal law regarding immigration status.\u000a______________\u000aImage: Flickr\u000aShare this:Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)MoreClick to print (Opens in new window)Click to share on Pinterest (Opens in new window)Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)Click to share on Google+ (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Tags: donald trump fake news Pitzer Pomona ScrippsCategories: Campus News

aS'CMC Funds Racially Exclusive Program to Fight Racism'
p327
aVOn January 25, Vince Greer \u2013 the Assistant Dean of Students for Diversity and Inclusion at Claremont McKenna College (CMC) \u2013 distributed the following message to the students, faculty and staff of the college:\u000a\u201cDear CMC community, The Cultural Influences on Mental Health Center at CMC is offering a FREE 8-week compassionate meditation program for ethnic minority students to learn how to heal from racism- and race-related incidents. Students must identify as an ethnic minority, must have experienced race-related stress, and must have attended one of the Claremont Colleges for at least one semester. If you meet these requirements and are in need of such services, you are eligible to sign up!\u201d [emphasis original.]\u000aDean Greer\u2019s email continues to state that while Professor Wei-Chin Hwang will head the  healing program, it will be \u201cco-led by two students.\u201d Hwang is a tenured, full-time professor of psychology at Claremont McKenna College with expertise in \u201cCultural Competency\u201d and \u201cRace & Social Problems.\u201d Greer\u2019s email to the community closes by making clear that the Institutional Review Board (IRB) of Claremont McKenna has approved the program.\u000aMany students have expressed concerns about the racial exclusivity of the program. Shawn McFall, (CMC \u201918), the President of the Claremont College Republicans, told the Independent, \u201cI find it disturbing that school funding is supporting a cause which excludes the majority of CMC students. Too many school programming centers which claim to represent and foster diversity have become mere tools for exclusion.\u201d\u000aAlex Ohlendorf (CMC \u201918) told the Independent, \u201cIt is troubling to see that CMC, an institution which just last year saw widespread movements against racism on campus, has approved and funded an event that specifically denies students the opportunity to participate on the basis of ethnicity. By creating such segregated programs, administrators only encourage political polarization and prevent dialogue.\u201d\u000aFollowing the above-mentioned protests at Claremont McKenna College in late 2015, President Hiram Chodosh wrote publicly that \u201cWe must ensure that each of our students shares a deep sense of belonging to the CMC community. Thus, I am committed to developing a thoughtful, productive, and responsible inclusion strategy, where every student is fully engaged and valued\u2026 No student or group on our campus should live and learn in isolation.\u201d\u000a______________\u000aImage: Flickr\u000aShare this:Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)MoreClick to print (Opens in new window)Click to share on Pinterest (Opens in new window)Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)Click to share on Google+ (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Tags: racism Safe SpacesCategories: Campus News

aS'The Electoral College: A Compromise'
p331
aVIn light of the 2016 Presidential Election, voters across the political spectrum have debated the usefulness of the Electoral College. The Electoral College is different from the popular vote because it awards votes to states rather than to individual voters. Functionally, this means that the candidate that wins the election need not win the most individual votes. While Hillary Clinton won the popular vote by almost three million votes, the Electoral College nevertheless serves as the final arbiter. Opponents of the Electoral College insist that this makes the Electoral College \u201cundemocratic,\u201d and therefore unfair. Others defend the Electoral College as it exists, saying that the point of the Electoral College is not to be democratic, but to increase representation for small states. \u000aThe solution, the proportional system, is to remove each state\u2019s winner-take-all provision in the Electoral College. Instead, a state\u2019s electors should be decided by the percentage of the popular vote within that state. For instance, if Hillary Clinton wins 62% of the vote in California, she would win roughly 62% of its electors. This means that winning a state by a fraction of a percentage point, as Donald Trump did with Michigan or Hillary Clinton did with New Hampshire, no longer disproportionately impacts the electoral college. \u000aThere are a few problems with using a nationwide popular vote for presidential elections. First, it is unworkable in practice, especially in close elections. In 2000, when the election was razor-thin in Florida, the recount took months to determine. If in a future election the popular vote is decided by a razor-thin margin, a prolonged fifty-state recount would be long and expensive. \u000aSecond, it is philosophically wrong to use a popular vote for President. As James Bovard put it, \u201cDemocracy must be something more than two wolves and a sheep voting on what to have for dinner.\u201d History is rife with majorities oppressing minorities, be they religious, racial, geographic, or otherwise. The Electoral College gives a voice to geopolitical minorities\u2014in this case, residents of small states. The founding fathers recognized the rights of small states, and they had no intention of creating a country ruled by pure majorities.\u000aFinally, a national popular vote neglects rural areas. Campaigns have limited resources; it is more efficient for presidential candidates to campaign in densely populated cities rather than small-town America because their campaigns will reach more people. TV ads, billboards, visits, and other campaign expenditures have a greater impact on the total number of votes when focused in major cities rather than rural America. If the criteria for winning the election is to get as many votes as possible, there is no incentive to campaign in sparsely populated rural states; therefore, candidates can ignore the unique problems that voters in these states face. Due to their diversity, residents of different states may view national controversies in different ways, and some questions are entirely localized. The Keystone Pipeline, for instance, impacts the Dakotas differently than it impacts the coastal states. For candidates to accurately represent all Americans, they must address the entire country\u2019s issues, not just the issues of states with high population densities.\u000aThis last problem of neglecting certain states, despite its intent, also happens in the Electoral College. The electoral college, as it exists today, does not force candidates to campaign in small states. Rather, it makes candidates spend their energy and money in swing states. Since a state like California is safely in the Democratic column, neither candidate will waste money campaigning there despite its large share of electoral votes. The same is true for deeply red states like Wyoming.  The candidates spend money on swing states of all sizes\u2014including small swing states like Nevada and New Hampshire and large swing states like Pennsylvania and Florida\u2014to maximize the impact of their limited funds. Although the swing states do change from year to year, many states\u2019 relevant issues are time-sensitive, but they are ignored because the Electoral College incentivizes candidates to spend their time elsewhere. The Founding Fathers did not intend for presidential candidates to spend the lion\u2019s share of their time on just a few states. Candidates should represent all fifty states, not just the strategically relevant ones.\u000aThe proportional system is preferable to both the Electoral College and the popular vote., It gives people reason to vote outside of the Democratic or Republican parties. People who vote for third-party candidates are not wasting their votes if their votes return electoral votes for their candidates. In fact, Gary Johnson, Jill Stein, and Evan McMullin all would have won some electoral votes in November\u2019s election had electoral votes been awarded proportionately rather than winner-take-all. These candidates would have won electoral votes even with the stigma that a vote for someone other than Hillary Clinton or Donald Trump is a wasted vote. When these candidates receive electoral votes, their ideas are included in the ongoing dialogue on national policy issues.\u000aAdditionally, it encourages voter turnout. On one hand, since candidates don\u2019t have to win a plurality of votes in a state to earn some electoral votes, the votes from California Republicans and Kansas Democrats now matter. On the other hand, California Democrats and Kansas Republicans have a strong incentive to vote and help their chosen candidate pick up as many electors from their state as possible.\u000aFinally, this system encourages candidates to campaign in all fifty states rather than only in states where the election will be close. Swing states already receive more national attention and funding during gubernatorial and senate elections. With a proportional allocation of electoral votes in each state, candidates can earn electoral votes from states that they don\u2019t win. Narrowly winning a key swing state will not clinch the election, and narrowly losing a key swing state will not surrender it. Under the proportional system, if candidates only campaign in swing states, they forego the opportunity to both maximize their margins in states where they have strong voter turnout and to minimize their losses in states where they trail their opponents.\u000aTwo states already split their electoral votes in a different way: Maine and Nebraska. While these states split their electoral votes by Congressional district rather than by percent of the statewide popular vote, these two states are more relevant in American politics since they are not winner-take-all. As Nebraska split its vote in 2008 and Maine split its vote in 2016, they get more national attention, even though they are not ordinarily swing states. Using Congressional districts might work in Nebraska and Maine, but such a solution would not work as well in a state like Pennsylvania or Maryland, where gerrymandering would substantially skew the results. \u000aThe Electoral College today is not what the Founding Fathers envisioned, but replacing it with a national popular vote is not the answer. If the Electoral College simply removes its winner-take-all requirements, it preserves the central compromise of American politics, dating back to the creation of the U.S. Congress. The Electoral College is not a relic of the past. It simply needs to be updated to represent all Americans, no matter their ideology or geography.\u000a______________\u000aImage: Flickr\u000aShare this:Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)MoreClick to print (Opens in new window)Click to share on Pinterest (Opens in new window)Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)Click to share on Google+ (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Categories: Opinion

aS'No Compromise'
p335
aVThanks to the Republicans, the federal government has been gridlocked for the last six years. The GOP almost shut the government down in 2015 by refusing to compromise with the White House on a budget deal. The Senate Majority Leader, Mitch McConnell, refused to even set a date for the Senate to discuss President Obama\u2019s Supreme Court nominee, saying it was up to the next president to nominate someone. As Election Day neared and a Clinton victory seemed likely, Republicans said they\u2019d be willing to block a Supreme Court nomination for the next four years. The Democrats looked on, smugly declaring that the Republicans were never willing to compromise and had sacrificed good government on the altar of partisan loyalty.\u000aBut now that Trump is about to take the White House, the Democrats and those who caucus with them on Capitol Hill have changed their tune. Recently, Senator Elizabeth Warren stated, \u201cWe do not compromise, not today, not tomorrow, not ever.\u201d Democrats praised her for her absolutism. A day later, Senator Bernie Sanders tweeted that there would be \u201cno compromise\u201d with the new president. Democrats lauded him as a hero, one of the last bulwarks for social justice in America.\u000aA \u2018no compromise\u2019 stance might work in a nation that is entirely homogeneous, but America is not that nation. If our government is going to work, there must be compromise on budgetary disputes, on nominations, and, yes, on social issues. The Democrats were happy to blame the Republicans for gridlock during Obama\u2019s terms, yet now they are just as happy to support Sanders and Warren for preparing to do the exact same thing. Somehow, all thought of bipartisan bills or compromise in any area has disappeared. Better, the Democrats seem to think, to make the government not function at all than to give up even an inch.\u000aAs a Democrat, I can admit that there are issues on which I would not want to see compromise. However, the Democrats are dismissing any possibility of compromise before the president-elect even takes office, simply because they think cooperation with Republicans is impossible. In fact, the two parties also agree on many issues: criminal justice reform and encouraging economic growth, for instance. While there is some disagreement on how to achieve these goals, there is still plenty of room for compromise from the Democrats and the Republicans. Both sides seem to have forgotten this, though, and in 2016, a bipartisan bill intended to reduce the number of sexual assaults in the military\u2014a cause both parties supported\u2014almost didn\u2019t pass, just because Democrats and Republicans were loathe to work with each other.\u000aThis is not to suggest that Democratic members of Congress ought to roll over and allow the Republicans to do whatever they want, nor is it to say that Republicans should have catered to President Obama\u2019s every whim. However, vowing to never compromise\u2014no matter which party does it\u2014should never be rewarded. Our government is built on compromise. If Democrats want to defend their constituents over the next four years, it will be through seeking common ground with Republicans, not by fostering an us-versus-them atmosphere that ends all meaningful conversations before they start.\u000aInstead of trying to lay the groundwork for future bipartisan cooperation, Democrats spent the last six years complaining about how Republican Congress refused to govern and blocked President Obama at every turn. Now, with a Republican about to enter the White House, those very same people are the ones yelling the loudest about how they will never compromise.\u000aNot all the Democrats have adopted this strategy. When Donald Trump won the national election, Chuck Schumer, a Democrat, set to work on building a political relationship with the president-elect. Schumer is seeking common ground with the new administration instead of deciding immediately that the Republicans and president-elect share no goals with the Democrats. Schumer\u2019s decision to compromise and open communication between the two parties will likely yield better results than vowing\u2014as Senator Warren and Sanders did\u2014to block every bill Republicans try to pass. And yet, Schumer is in the minority. Most of the Democratic Party has flooded towards Sanders and Warren, agreeing that it is better to stop the government from working for anyone than to compromise on any issue.\u000aThe American people need to stop rewarding politicians for refusing to budge on any of their beliefs and start rewarding them for actually doing their job: namely, passing bills. We elect Congress to govern, not shut down the government by refusing to compromise. A Congress that can\u2019t agree on a budget is as useful as a Supreme Court with no justices.\u000a______________\u000aImage: Flickr\u000aShare this:Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)MoreClick to print (Opens in new window)Click to share on Pinterest (Opens in new window)Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)Click to share on Google+ (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Categories: Opinion

aS'Meet Incoming Pomona President G. Gabrielle Starr'
p339
aVDr. G. Gabrielle Starr will become Pomona College\u2019s 10th president on July 1st, 2017 after current president David Oxtoby steps down. She is a scholar of English and cognitive neuroscience and is currently serving as the Seryl Kushner Dean of the College of Arts and Science at New York University. Dr. Starr was kind enough answer some questions that I sent to her on behalf of the Independent regarding her thoughts on issues such as a need-blind admissions process for international students, the role of safe spaces on campus, and how to improve upon the services that Pomona provides. What follows are the questions posed to Dr. Starr and her answers, edited for concision and clarity.\u000a \u000aCI: Under the current administration, Pomona College has undergone a lot of growth: Pomona achieved the top slot in Forbes\u2019 2015 college ranking and the class of 2018, consisting of roughly 450 students, is the largest in our school\u2019s history. Yet, Pomona also prides itself on its position as a small liberal arts college with a focus on academics. How do you plan on reconciling the need for Pomona to continue to grow and adapt while also maintaining its unique place in academia?\u000aGS: Pomona is built on the idea that rigorous thinking, exploration, and discovery ought to occur in intimate communities of scholars, and I fully agree. The unique strength of Pomona, however, is that close links with The Claremont Colleges enrich the possibilities for intellectual growth for everyone. I don\u2019t think that \u201cgrowth\u201d always means increasing the number of students in such a context. Growth for a liberal arts college means continually expanding knowledge and opportunity for faculty, students, and staff. That, at this moment, is what I am interested in exploring with the Pomona community.\u000a \u000aCI: Pomona College\u2019s student code lacks mens rea standards for most of its statutes. This means that students can be held accountable for violating a complex array of rules and regulations even when they\u2019ve done so by accident. What are your initial thoughts on this and on the possibility of amending the student code?\u000aGS: The focus of student conduct codes must be on maintaining the highest standards of ethical behavior and on making the community whole after a breach, and this means we have to take intent into account at various stages in the process. However, I have long seen, through my time as a teacher and dean, that many violations of community or of conduct standards are matters of fact, not intention, so there is a balance here. Overall, I care about fairness and equity, and a conduct process that enables people to learn from mistakes.\u000a \u000aCI: As a school that prides itself on its academics, Pomona College often leans on the more pre-professional Claremont McKenna College when it comes to career services; however, many of these services, such as mock case interviews, are only offered to Claremont McKenna students. While it may be early for you to be thinking about this problem, it is a time-sensitive one that continues to affect students during each new interview cycle. With that in mind, what are your initial thoughts on this issue and on improvements that could be made to our career services office?\u000aGS: The primary mission of Pomona is to provide a superior liberal arts education and to endow in its graduates the lifetime skills of critical and analytical reasoning that make for a transformative life. That means we are always keenly aware of the way that students enter the world beyond our gates. We share resources with the other Claremont Colleges, and that makes us stronger. I see my role as fostering the life of the mind and the life of the whole student, while also fostering active engagement in the larger world through the life, work, and career concerns of our students. As I move into the office, I will certainly pay close attention to how well Pomona\u2019s students are served in this area, and also across the board. Pomona has expanded its Career Development Office significantly over the past few years and this may be another area that can be addressed more specifically.\u000a \u000aCI: Pomona College touts its on-campus diversity and inclusion, but only provides a need-blind admission process to U.S. citizens and those who have graduated from a U.S. high school. Other colleges, including those with smaller per-student endowments such as Amherst College and MIT, provide a need-blind admissions process to all students. What are your thoughts on changing our admissions process so that all students are considered equally, regardless of their financial situation or citizenship status? \u000aGS: Offering financial aid to the many extraordinary students of Pomona is a pillar of the College. We live in an increasingly global world, and Pomona has done a good job expanding the number of international students, the areas of the world they come from, and the number who receive aid. Any changes to the admissions policy would have to be approved by the trustees, and changes in financial aid would have to be fiscally responsible for the College. I look forward to being on campus and learning more about how we can advance our work in this area.\u000a \u000aCI: Pomona is not only demographically diverse; these diverse demographics actually translate into a student body where students belonging to different groups are willing to interact with each other and exchange ideas. Safe spaces are a thorny issue. While they do provide a healing space for many on campus, there are also real concerns that these spaces amount to school-funded echo chambers that give institutional credence to the idea that students don\u2019t need to engage with those who think differently than they do. As president of Pomona College, how do you plan on reconciling these opposing concerns regarding safe spaces?\u000aGS: Freedom of speech is a right that emerges in the context of contest, of dispute. Non-controversial statements never end up evoking questions of free speech. It is when we disagree that free speech matters most. Disagreement and dispute, however, are fundamental to education and to the life of the mind. I expect students to stand up for what they believe in and to listen to and engage with others. Colleges have a special responsibility to model that open engagement. We provide the arena for the rigorous exchange of ideas, and regardless of one\u2019s partisan affiliations or ideological views, we are all part of one community. I expect Pomona to be a place where every individual speaks out and is heard.\u000aSome people hear the word \u201csafe space\u201d and immediately shut down. My goal for Pomona is constant renewal of a community of trust. Trust in speech and action is not the sole responsibility of the speaker or the spoken to. It is established through a mutual understanding that words have meaning. We will not always agree; however, through strength of community, we can establish an environment where ideas and experiences can be shared and examined in the spirit of mutual respect.\u000a \u000aCI: On the subject of diversity, Pomona puts in a commendable amount of effort into making many groups feel comfortable on campus. Yet there are still groups on campus that feel marginalized; recently, for example, a pro-Palestinian group painted a mural on Walker Wall with clear anti-Israel overtones. How does your administration plan on reaching out to these people\u2014such as Jews, conservatives, and others who often face unwarranted hostility on campus\u2014and fostering a dialogue with them?\u000aGS: Pomona is engaged and inquisitive and it is a true community. The world is rife with fractious issues: BDS, Standing Rock, \u201cbuild that wall\u201d, DACA, climate change, and beyond. The loudest or the most ready and commercial voices can often define perceptions and inflame passions.  And indeed, passions move faster than truth and real information in the modern world. We must understand, however, that reasoned, principled people can view an information set and come to opposite points of view. Our job is to develop tools and arenas so that the essential points are uncovered, and reasoned debate can occur if\u2013and that \u201cif\u201d is rhetorical\u2013we want to arrive at better conclusions and wider civic engagement.\u000aPomona belongs to every member of our community. That sense of real inclusion is what I truly love about my life as a teacher and a scholar and, soon, what I will stand for as president of Pomona.\u000a \u000aCI: Finally, in your interview with The Student Life, you mentioned some of your short-term goals, including working with faculty to help them get more resources. What specific policies do you hope to implement or continue with in order to achieve these goals, and what are other specific policies you hope to achieve during your tenure as president of Pomona College?\u000aGS: Pomona is fortunate by just about every standard in the resources we have available. Yet fundraising for faculty research and curricular development will be an important part of building on the level of distinction Pomona enjoys. One focus of my presidency will be to work with faculty, foundations, and private donors to ensure we don\u2019t ever lose track of what faculty need to help their scholarship have an even greater impact on changing students\u2019 lives and the world.\u000aIf I might say one last thing, I am eager to be a part of one of the strongest intellectual communities in this country, and I am grateful to the students, faculty, and staff for their engagement in the search, to the search committee, and to the trustees.\u000a______________\u000aImage: Flickr\u000a \u000aShare this:Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)MoreClick to print (Opens in new window)Click to share on Pinterest (Opens in new window)Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)Click to share on Google+ (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Categories: Feature

aS'What a Late-Night Uber Taught Me About American Politics'
p343
aVOn Tuesday night, as the final tendrils of orange and red light faded from the evening skies in Washington D.C., I packed my bags and left my apartment for Dulles International Airport, ready to enjoy the Thanksgiving holiday with my family in California. Loaded up with a backpack and a small duffel slung over my shoulder, I ducked into my waiting Uber, exchanging the usual pleasantries with the driver.\u000aMo was quiet. His smooth olive skin and earnest eyes belied his years. He drove cautiously, but with the classic impatience of a Washington D.C. resident, nudging the nose of his van into crosswalks to exploit openings in the stream of pedestrians. We chatted idly for a few minutes about my time in Washington, the weather, and the gridlocked rush-hour traffic.\u000aBut then our talk turned to the election.\u000a\u201cAmerica is the land of opportunity,\u201d he told me. \u201cThis is the only place where you can go and do anything.\u201d\u000aIn addition to driving for Uber, Mo arranges shipments of produce to the Washington D.C. area from Florida and other major agricultural states. He makes a good living this way, and he is proud of it. \u201cI make good money,\u201d he said several times, his face beaming.\u000aMo is an immigrant. He came to the United States on a green card in the late nineties and has lived and worked in Washington ever since. He has been able to renew his green card in the past, but he fears that under the new administration, he might lose his residency and be forced to return to his country.\u000a\u201cI don\u2019t know if what he says is just rhetoric,\u201d he explained, referring to president-elect Trump. \u201cWhat he says about immigrants in this country illegally, who are committing crimes; I agree. But a lot of these immigrants are good people, hard-working people. They contribute to this country.\u201d\u000aAs we came to a halt at another red light, Mo shifted his gaze to the Washington Monument, rising up out of the ground only a few hundred yards away. \u201cI have met many undocumented people in my job,\u201d he said. \u201cAll of them are good people, making an honest living. Their families are here. Their children go to school here. They are afraid that they will be taken away and sent out of this country.\u201d\u000aEven though President Obama has deported more illegal immigrants than all of his predecessors, Mo pointed out, the rhetoric of the fierce 2016 campaign has terrified his undocumented colleagues. Last November, Donald Trump promised to build a \u201cdeportation force\u201d to send all illegal immigrants, regardless of whether they had committed crimes in the U.S., back to their countries of origin. He has since softened his position.\u000a\u201cI\u2019ve been here for several past elections,\u201d he said. \u201cI was here for Bush and for Obama, both times.\u201d\u000aHe looked directly at me in the rearview mirror.\u000a\u201cBut this fear? I\u2019ve never seen it before.\u201d\u000a***\u000aI have had trouble grasping the true extent of the emotions that have roiled this nation over the course of the election season. Before Election Day, I sensed the anger of conservatives with the status quo, but I never understood its depth until Donald Trump swept the Rust Belt on November 8th to become our president.\u000aConservatives have long chafed at the derision and condescension of the left, but recent years have deepened their frustration. To President Obama and other progressive icons, Republican political opponents do not simply disagree about how to make America a better place; instead, they occupy \u201cthe wrong side of history,\u201d as the president himself has often said. They are bigots, misogynists, and racists, and their economic grievances and political anxieties are without merit. And someday, only a few decades further along the arc of history, their evil, backwards political inclinations will perish from the earth, and the good\u2014progressivism\u2014will triumph at last.\u000aCoastal liberals, ensconced in their ivory towers in Washington and the university, continue to claim that they know best. They are the self-appointed defenders of truth and justice, visionaries bent on fixing our deeply flawed and broken nation. If only the hapless hicks supporting the Republican Party would wise up, absorb the teachings of the enlightened class, and understand how good they have it, the nation might make progress in helping those facing real hardship. As one bitter columnist at Jezebel wrote in the days following the election, the \u201cgrievances\u201d of Donald Trump\u2019s working-class supporters \u201cranged anywhere from distrusting Hillary Clinton as much as they did Obama to believing in racial stereotypes and feeling put-upon by \u2018PC\u2019 culture.\u201d\u000aBut to the middle-aged factory worker in the Midwest who has lost his job and does not know where to turn to provide for his family, these criticisms are nothing short of insulting. He voted for Barack Obama, believing in the promise and hope of the young then-senator\u2019s presidential campaign. But since then, things seem to have only gotten worse.\u000aPresident Obama has overseen the weakest economic recovery since the Great Depression, with most of this rebound benefitting America\u2019s urban hubs. Meanwhile, the globalized economy grinds on, sweeping middle-class industrial jobs out of America\u2019s heartland and into the cheap labor markets of China, Mexico, and southeast Asia. In the factories that have survived, automated technologies have replaced bustling crews of laborers with robots and an occasional human overseer. To the victims of these powerful waves of change, blue-collar America is dying\u2014and Barack Obama\u2019s hope and youthful idealism did nothing to stop it.\u000aThis election manifested the desperation of middle America. Few Americans actually liked Donald Trump. Nearly seven-in-ten voters viewed Donald Trump unfavorably. They found his behavior to be beyond the pale. His proposal to ban all Muslims was inexcusable, and his vow to build a wall was laughable. Yet nearly half voted for him anyway\u2014because in the end, Donald Trump meant change, and change was what they needed. It\u2019s as simple as that.\u000a***\u000aBut with the turmoil of change comes uncertainty and, for immigrants like Mo, the frightening prospect that they no longer can pursue their dreams in the land of the free. Which Donald Trump should they believe: the one who promised to deport every illegal immigrant and to stop issuing green cards for foreign workers, or the one who will only deport \u201ccriminal\u201d aliens and will \u201creform\u201d legal immigration?\u000aMo is worried that it might be the former.\u000a\u201cWhen I was seventeen, eighteen, as a young guy, I came to this country, so you know that adjusting\u2014that will be really hard for job adjustment in my old country,\u201d he explained. \u201cI am right now sixteen, seventeen years in this country. What will I do if I go back?\u201d\u000a\u201cWhen I drive for Uber, I pay my insurance, I pay my road taxes, I pay my rent,\u201d Mo continued, an edge creeping into his soft-spoken voice. \u201cI contribute to America. Someday, I might buy a house. But if I\u2019m not here, how can I do that? How can I contribute to this great country?\u201d\u000aHe glanced at me in the mirror. \u201cThe undocumented immigrants, they contribute too,\u201d he added. \u201cWithout them, this country\u2019s agriculture would be nothing. The fields would be empty\u2014and no one would take those jobs.\u201d\u000aIn the end, as traffic finally began to pick up, Mo expressed a hint of optimism. \u201cI am lucky,\u201d he mused as he steered the car onto the freeway. \u201cI have a wife here who is a U.S. citizen, so I will probably be okay.\u201d\u000a\u201cBut I really don\u2019t know.\u201d\u000aShare this:Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)MoreClick to print (Opens in new window)Click to share on Pinterest (Opens in new window)Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)Click to share on Google+ (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Categories: Feature

aVTrump\u2019s nomination had little to do with social issues. Yes, Donald Trump promised to ban Muslims from entering the country. Yes, Trump claimed a ruling on his for-profit scam university was biased because the deciding judge was Mexican. And yes, Trump probably still thinks that Barack Obama was born in Kenya. But none of that is why Trump won the Midwest. President-elect Trump won the Midwest because of his protectionist economic and trade policy. For the part of America that has been left behind by globalization and the economic recovery, Donald Trump\u2019s policies offered hope.\u000aPost-election exit polling supports this contention. According to CNN exit surveys, in Ohio, Iowa, Wisconsin, and Michigan, the economy was the most important issue to a majority of voters. And though Hillary Clinton did hold a narrow margin lead over Trump among these voters, her lead evaporated when trade came up. 48 percent of Ohioans and half of Wisconsinites felt that trade hampered U.S. jobs, and of these voters, two-thirds broke for Trump. Additionally, 54 percent of Wisconsinites, 52 percent of Ohioans, and 52 percent of Iowans agreed that Trump would handle the economy better than his opponent.\u000aExit polls are not the best way to predict who will win an election because their samples are not always random. But they still can help us understand how different demographics voted\u2014and why they did.\u000aEmployment numbers in the Midwest are abysmal when compared to the rest of the US. According to the Center on Wisconsin Strategy, Wisconsin did not reach pre-recession employment levels until September 2015. But measured from before the Great Recession, the state\u2019s growing working age population resulted in a job deficit of 102,060 by September 2015, which means that there were 102,060 fewer jobs available than Wisconsinites could find. In Ohio, the same holds true. Only 62.3 percent of Ohio adults are still in the labor market, and the state has not only seen a decrease in the number of jobs available but also in inflation-adjusted wages.\u000aIt is also important to look at the industries that represent Middle America. Alabama, Michigan, Iowa, Ohio, Kentucky, Wisconsin, North Carolina, Louisiana, Oregon, and Indiana are the 10 states that in 2012 relied the most on manufacturing for state GDP. According to the Federal Reserve Economic Data database, this is the quarterly percent change in manufacturing output in the United States since Q2 2012:

aS'President Oxtoby Denies Wrongdoing As IRS Complaint Filed Against Pomona College'
p351
aVThe Claremont Independent has learned that a concerned individual has lodged a complaint with the IRS in response to Pomona College\u2019s promotion and funding of an anti-Trump rally.\u000aAs the Independent reported this week, Pomona College\u2019s Draper Center for Community Partnerships may have run afoul of federal non-profit regulations by reimbursing transportation costs to and from a rally against Donald Trump in Los Angeles on November 9th. Draper Center staff also promoted the event on Facebook and organized bus transportation for students who wished to attend.\u000aAs a 501(c)(3) educational institution, Pomona College is prohibited from engaging in partisan political activity with tax-exempt dollars. If an investigation is launched, it could lead to the revocation of Pomona College\u2019s tax-exempt status, among other possible sanctions.\u000aIn a statement to the Independent, the office of Pomona College President David Oxtoby acknowledged the College\u2019s financial commitment to the rallies but stressed that it did not constitute political activity:\u000a\u201cThe Draper Center for Community Partnerships is committed to fostering civic engagement among students, and our students engage in various community based courses, programs, projects and events across Southern California. Transportation is typically part of our support for student engagement, as was the case with the recent rallies.  The College does not consider this to be activity in support of a political campaign.\u201d\u000aMaria Tucker, the Director of the Draper Center and an Associate Dean of Students, stopped responding to requests for comment on Monday. As of this morning, she had deleted or made private a November 9th post on her Facebook account discussing the election results:\u000a\u201cI\u2019m always surprised by those who believe in America as a place for pulling oneself up by our bootstraps/hard work wins. They tend to be the folks most reliant on the backs of others to make them win: \u2026racists, misogynists, most especially. Today was a win for both.\u201d\u000aThe Draper Center, which Ms. Tucker heads, says its mission \u201cis to foster mutually beneficial exchanges among community members, students, faculty, and staff in order to support educational outreach initiatives, community-based research and learning, and other community engagement activities.\u201d \u000aThe Claremont Independent will continue to cover this story as it develops.\u000a______________\u000aImage: Flickr\u000aShare this:Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)MoreClick to print (Opens in new window)Click to share on Pinterest (Opens in new window)Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)Click to share on Google+ (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Categories: Campus News

aS'Pomona College May Have Violated 501(c)(3) Tax Status to Fund Anti-Trump Protesters'
p355
aVBy funding the transportation of students to and from anti-Trump rallies in the Los Angeles area with tuition dollars, Pomona College\u2019s Draper Center for Community Partnership may have violated IRS regulations prohibiting tax-exempt educational institutions from engaging in partisan political activity.\u000aOn Wednesday, November 9, the day after Republican Donald J. Trump became president-elect of the United States, anti-Trump protests sprung up throughout the country. Some of these protests were against the hate and violence activists have associated with Trump and his followers towards Jewish, immigrant, Muslim, and LGBTQ communities, among others. Some protests were against Trump himself.\u000aFor one protest, which took place on Wednesday evening outside of Los Angeles City Hall, Pomona College\u2019s Draper Center for Community Partnership organized buses to take students to the protest and offered to reimburse other students who attended for their travel costs.\u000aAs the Independent reported this morning, the Draper Center has also funded \u201canti-hate\u201d rallies with anti-Trump undertones. But since these protests deal explicitly with issues rather than candidates, the Draper Center is likely within its legal rights to support them, even if some may object to an organization that espouses community partnership involving itself in political issues.\u000aWednesday\u2019s protest at the L.A. City Hall, however, was explicitly anti-Trump. On Facebook, its organizers wrote that \u201c[i]t is imperative that all people unite to resist this vile racist and sexist demagogue\u2026. Only the people can put a stop to this. Let\u2019s unite Los Angeles from day one to say, \u2018Down with Trump!\u2019\u201d\u000aRepresentatives of the Draper Center knew of and appeared to support the partisan objectives of the protest. In a post shared in several private Facebook groups for Pomona College students, the student coordinator of the Draper Center solicited attendees for the protest. \u201cThe Draper Center is organizing a bus that will take students to downtown LA TONIGHT to stand against Trump,\u201d she wrote, linking to a sign-up form entitled \u201cBus Ride to Rally Against Trump in LA.\u201d\u000aThe Draper Center is not a student-run organization. Rather, like KSPC, the campus radio station, it is an organization staffed and funded by Pomona College. The College pays the salaries of the Draper Center\u2019s staff, and Maria Tucker, the director of the Draper Center, also serves as an associate dean of students on campus. The Draper Center also receives funding each year from the Associated Students of Pomona College (ASPC), which in turn draws over 98 percent of its income from mandatory student fees.\u000aAs an educational institution, Pomona College is tax-exempt under section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code. This designation permits alumni to donate to the College tax-free and exempts the College from federal income taxes. However, this special status comes with certain conditions, including a prohibition on partisan political activity.\u000aAccording to the IRS, \u201call 501(c)(3) organizations are absolutely prohibited from directly or indirectly participating in, or intervening in, any political campaign on behalf of (or in opposition to) any candidate for elective public office.\u201d Although Donald Trump\u2019s official candidacy for the 2016 general election ended on November 8th, he began accepting donations for his 2020 primary campaign on the 9th, the same day Pomona College\u2019s Draper Center began organizing and reimbursing transportation to anti-Trump rallies. According to federal guidelines, this makes Mr. Trump a political candidate. The Draper Center\u2019s actions also come in the context of an ongoing effort to persuade members of the Electoral College\u2014the body of electors that officially selects the next president on December 19th\u2014to vote for Clinton.\u000aFunding opposition to a political candidate, as the Draper Center did, would appear to violate the IRS\u2019 prohibition of partisan political activity by 501(c)(3) educational institutions. And in light of a recent campus-wide email blast from a high-level campus administrator promoting an anti-Trump march on campus, the Draper Center\u2019s conduct is even more difficult to explain.\u000aThe Independent has reached out to the Draper Center for comment and plans to update this story accordingly\u000aShare this:Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)MoreClick to print (Opens in new window)Click to share on Pinterest (Opens in new window)Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)Click to share on Google+ (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Categories: Opinion

The school can do what it sees fit as a private institution. I don\u2019t see it as a political move so much as an attempt to help cover the financial costs of political activism. If it allows more people from disadvantaged backgrounds to protest, it\u2019s fine with me,\u201d Eliot Sands (PO\u2019 20) told the Independent in a message.\u000aPomona College is a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization.\u000aShare this:Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)MoreClick to print (Opens in new window)Click to share on Pinterest (Opens in new window)Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)Click to share on Google+ (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Categories: Campus News

p363
aVOn Thursday, the Pomona College Orchestra informed its musicians that they could opt out of performing the song Don Juan in their upcoming concert because the piece\u2014which centers around the libertine Don Juan character\u2014could be insensitive to students who were upset by the election of Donald Trump.\u000a\u201cWhen I programmed Don Juan, the presidential nominees of the two major parties were known, and the smart money was on a Clinton victory\u2026You have worked immensely hard on this piece, and it is a great musical accomplishment\u2026I would prefer not to cancel our performances of it,\u201d the conductor of the Pomona College Orchestra stated in an e-mail to the orchestra. \u201cBut I understand that some of you may have serious reservations, especially in the wake of Tuesday\u2019s results, about appearing to embrace a narrative that presents women as objects to be pursued by wealthy males who can get away with it. And I need you to know that I respect those reservations\u2026I extend to each of you the invitation to opt out of our performances of Don Juan.\u201d\u000a\u201cThe character of Don Juan was introduced in 1630 Spanish stage work. It was intended as a satirical morality play, the lesson being that, no matter how hedonistically one might live one\u2019s life, sins must be atoned for at the end,\u201d the email continues. \u201cDon Juan is what we would charitably refer to as a \u2018womanizer,\u2019 and that with clearer vision we would identify as a sexual predator,\u201d the e-mail states, adding that \u201cthe question of how to engage art that has a troubling backstory is always complicated.\u201d\u000aThe e-mail added that the orchestra \u201cwill try to find guests to fill in any holes that get created\u2026Assuming we still have enough of an orchestra to present the piece, the show will go on.\u201d\u000aUltimately, no member of the orchestra chose to drop out of the performance, according to an e-mail update.  \u201cI enjoy the music of Don Juan purely for its musical value rather than its programmatic inspiration,\u201d stated a member of the orchestra in a message to the Independent.\u000aThe concert set featuring Don Juan will take place on Friday, November 18th and Sunday, November 20th at Pomona College\u2019s Bridges Hall of Music. The Pomona College Orchestra consists of students and faculty of the Claremont Colleges as well as members of the community.\u000a________________\u000aImage: Flickr\u000aShare this:Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)MoreClick to print (Opens in new window)Click to share on Pinterest (Opens in new window)Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)Click to share on Google+ (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Tags: donald trump election Political CorrectnessCategories: Campus News

aS'After the Election: Trump, Clinton, and the Death of Dialogue'
p367
aVNo matter which candidate wins tonight\u2019s presidential election, the American people have already lost. This isn\u2019t because both Secretary Clinton and Mr. Trump are poor choices; as I have written before, I think Secretary Clinton would make an excellent president. Rather, the American people are losing because we\u2019ve lost the ability to communicate with each other\u000aIt is easier than ever today to entomb oneself in an echo chamber. Schools today are more homogeneous than ever, social media allows for the selective consumption of news, and political gerrymandering has created an environment in which likeminded individuals are lumped together in the same congressional district. In our society, there are now far fewer places in which dialogue between differently minded groups can occur and our dysfunctional schools, bottom-line-focused media, and politically drawn legislative districts exacerbate this trend. Trump supporters and Clinton supporters no longer have access to fora in which they can communicate with each other; instead Trump supporters instinctively distrust all things Clinton and Clinton supporters condescend to all things Trump, including his supporters. Have you recently had a respectful conversation with someone who supports a candidate other than your own? American politics has always been rancorous, but this death of dialogue has created a new level of polarization.\u000aPolarization has also gridlocked our legislature\u2014the most recently completed 113th Congress was the second-least productive in history, second only to the 112th Congress. And as our legislative branch has been crippled, the presidency has been endowed with unprecedented levels of power. The president can now effectively unilaterally declare war thanks to the 2001 Authorization for Use of Military Force (AUMF), can effectively enact treaties with a simple majority vote in the Senate rather than having to cobble together a supermajority thanks to the rise and acceptance of so-called congressional-executive agreements, and can wantonly choose which laws to enforce due to lax applications of the Constitution\u2019s Take Care Clause.\u000aThis inflation of presidential powers has only served to further exacerbate the polarization in the country. Suddenly, a President Trump could by himself decide to send troops into Syria thanks to the AUMF or withdraw from NAFTA without congressional approval since it\u2019s a congressional-executive agreement and not a treaty. A President Clinton could decide to cease all deportation immediately now that the Constitution\u2019s Take Care Clause is no longer enforced. With so much power endowed to one individual, voters can no longer risk listening to and electing someone who doesn\u2019t share their party line.\u000aSo how can this polarization be overcome? The only way forward is to repair basic American institutions so that they promote dialogue between those of differing views. First, colleges should try to enroll politically diverse student bodies and actively promote civic discussion among them, not focus all of their attention onto the proliferation of safe spaces. As a liberal college student myself, I was drawn to write for this publication because of the diversity of political and social views that are professed in its articles and the dialogue it fosters on campus, despite the fact that said dialogue can get rather heated at times. The drawing of electoral districts should be delegated to independent committees. Social media should change their algorithms so that users aren\u2019t just fed articles with which they already agree. And people should reflect on the tone of this election and think about how they could have made it just a little less nasty through proactive engagement. Once this occurs, polarization will return to previous levels, the legislature will once again become vibrant and again become a check on the executive office, which will in turn serve to further decrease polarization as presidential elections become less important and thus less nasty. We didn\u2019t accomplish this in time for this election cycle, but hopefully the sheer vitriol of this race will serve as a wakeup call before the next one.\u000aShare this:Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)MoreClick to print (Opens in new window)Click to share on Pinterest (Opens in new window)Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)Click to share on Google+ (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Tags: donald trump election Free Speech hillary clinton Safe SpacesCategories: Opinion

aS'The Clinton Emails You Haven\xe2\x80\x99t Heard About'
p371
aVHillary Clinton\u2019s emails have been a thorough topic of debate, but the information that has been made readily public is only a small part of the scandal. Many people simply assume that the only topics of interest in her emails are Benghazi and corporate interests, but the emails contain far more secrets that were hidden until Julian Assange released troves of previously submerged documents with massive implications.\u000aFirst off, Morocco contributed 12 million dollars to the Clinton Foundation and her campaign. Huma Abedin in 2014 disclosed, \u201cThe King has personally committed approx $12 million both for the endowment and to support the meeting. It will break a lot of china to back out now when we had so many opportunities to do it in the past few months.\u201d This quotation taken directly from the emails draws a clear connection between the two, but Politico later reported that while $1 million can be directly traced, the Clinton Foundation has refused to release reports on the other $11 million given for largely unknown reasons. While it is true that she was not Secretary of State at the time, and that there is no direct wording within the documents that would imply she received these donations for political favors, it does raise the question as to why Morocco would generously give such a substantial sum out of the kindness of their hearts.\u000aInitially, governmental funding of the Clintons may not sound like much, but the problem lies in emails that were sent at the beginning of 2014, where she maps out certain ISIS endowments. Specifically, the email reads, \u201cThe Governments of Qatar and Saudi Arabia, which are providing clandestine financial support to ISIL and other radical Sunni groups in the region.\u201d Two days ago, Reuters confirmed that Clinton\u2019s charity had received $1 million dollars from the government of Qatar while she was Secretary of State in exchange for a meeting with former president Bill Clinton and John Podesta. In essence, the same government that is currently funding ISIS and has been accused of countless human rights abuses has significant ties to the Clintons, starting when she was still in a major seat of power. Saudi Arabia specifically has donated between $10-25 million dollars under the proxy foundation \u201cFriends of Saudi Arabia\u201d since 1997. The only problem with honing these numbers down to a more specific amount is that finding the information from either the Clinton Foundation or private reports are difficult at best. The end result to take away from this is that Qatar and Saudi Arabia, two governments that directly support ISIS financially and logistically, have supplied millions to the Clintons and their foundation both during president Bill Clinton\u2019s administration and during Hilary\u2019s time as secretary of state. ISIS and the Clinton Foundation are being bankrolled by the same governments.\u000aDuring Hillary Clinton\u2019s time as secretary of state, not only were questionable donations made, but she approved surprising arms sales between the Unites States and Saudi Arabia. Julian Assange stated, \u201cUnder Hillary Clinton, and Clinton emails reveal a significant discussion about it, the largest ever arms deal in the world was made with Saudi Arabia. More than $80 billion dollars.\u201d Along with the $80 billion deal with Saudi Arabia, the total dollar amount of US arms sales internationally doubled during her time as secretary of state.\u000aBesides the financial support of these Middle Eastern governments, some speculation on the word \u201clogistics\u201d used in Clinton\u2019s emails could imply that guns sold to Saudi Arabia by the United States could have been in turn given to ISIS by Saudi Arabia. While there is admittedly no proof of this, it is curious how a state with as small of a military as Saudi Arabia could make use of $80 billion dollars of US arms on their own. While Hillary Clinton may have only been a part of all these backroom dealings that the American public has been largely kept in the dark on, it must be noted that she has played an instrumental role in the massive sales of munitions between the United States and certain Middle Eastern governments.\u000a______________\u000aImage: Flickr\u000aShare this:Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)MoreClick to print (Opens in new window)Click to share on Pinterest (Opens in new window)Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)Click to share on Google+ (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Tags: election Emails hillary clinton ISIS ScandalCategories: Opinion

aS'Should I Vote?'
p375
aVWhen the two most popular candidates are as disliked as Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump, it becomes difficult to decide whether or not to vote. Our more ardent friends tell us that voting is a constitutional obligation. They say that it stands for all the people who died for our right to vote, but neglect to say that you ought to vote for your values. Voting for one\u2019s values has been the way that America has operated for generations. This can be seen in the election of 1912, with Woodrow Wilson, William Howard Taft, Eugene V. Debbs, and Theodore Roosevelt. The election held four parties: democratic, republican, socialist, and the progressive party, and each one adequately represented a different sector of the voting base. The democrats with Woodrow Wilson took just over 41% of the popular vote, but won by a landslide in the electoral college due to the diverse options that the American people were given. Even the most removed candidate, Eugene V. Debbs with the socialist party, received 6% of the popular vote, which is more than what Gary Johnson is currently polling nationwide.\u000aIf the candidate does not represent you, why should you vote for them? Recently, the question has changed from \u201cWho should I vote for?\u201d and has become \u201cWho should I vote against?\u201d With the assistance of party-line voters, more elections are being decided on the lesser of two evils rather than a popularly appealing candidate. This consequentialist mindset can be extremely dangerous. On one hand, it allows an individual to assess the \u201cgreatest good,\u201d but it also reduces the possibility for change. Third party candidates are at the mercy of party-line voters, who make up such a strong majority of the voting population that the candidate on the outside has to fight against the predisposition to vote for whichever party the voter is affiliated with. Specifically, the fear that the more radical and ignoble side will win. This encourages a false dichotomy that forces the potentially interested voter to act out of fear of the opponent rather than out of an interest in improving the country because the chances of a third party candidate are almost entirely ruined by party-line voting.\u000aThe other major problem with consequentialism is that it devalues individuals\u2019 ideals. In the 1964 election, voters overwhelmingly voted for Lyndon B. Johnson not because they particularly liked him or agreed with his values, but rather because Barry Goldwater was so extreme and bigoted that no one wanted to be associated with his name. The electoral vote was a landslide, with 486 for Johnson and 52 for Goldwater. This doctrine places the consequence of the election above what the individual actually desires. Voters may be forced to compromise their values in favor of a net beneficial effect. Further, when compromise is made, internal party reform becomes challenging. If the individual concedes on topics that may be critical to them, they will have to accept whatever outcome they receive regardless of their ideals. The consequences of these outcomes inevitably degrade the voter\u2019s values. At some point, they may sacrifice enough of their morals that they do not even know their own values anymore. When they come to the point where their moral inconsistency is acceptable, then their good becomes indistinguishable from the opposition they find so heinous.\u000aThe conclusion of this argument implies that you should only vote to your values and disregard the consequences, but there are major problems that follow with this train of thought as well, which lie in the neglect of the consequences. This may sound odd given the problems with solely valuing the consequences, but entirely disregarding them can also be problematic. While stating that no compromises can be made does solve the problem of internal value degradation, it implies that if a candidate does not fulfill every last one of your values, then they are not worth voting for. This can lead to an outcome where extremely harmful and disadvantageous political candidates are able to win because their values resonated with the largest group of voters, even though their supporters may be a national minority. For example, if only a tenth of the population held the same set of extreme values, and the remainder of the population held differing moderate positions, then a candidate who represents the smaller portion could win if the remaining eligible voters abdicated their vote because they did not connect enough with a representative. This can lead to harmful long-term effects on the nation as a whole, as the candidate who held the values of that decile of the population now holds the power of the nation.\u000aThe final option between values and consequences lies in compromise. Someone can understand that consequences are important but also take into account that they need to consider their values. The difficulty here is finding the proper balance between these ideals. From voter to voter they will be different, and perhaps they will even be indescribable, but as long as people understand that a proper vote requires consideration of both of these things, then perhaps we could have a viable election that balances the ideals of the people. When answering the question, \u201cshould I vote?\u201d only the voter can decide by weighing their values against the dangers of the opposition.\u000a_______________\u000aImage: Flickr\u000aShare this:Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)MoreClick to print (Opens in new window)Click to share on Pinterest (Opens in new window)Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)Click to share on Google+ (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Tags: electionCategories: Opinion

aS'Pomona Progressives Create Whites-Only Club To Fight Racism'
p379
aVOn Monday evening, a number of White Pomona College students formed a new club called \u201cWe\u2019ve Got Work To Do: White People for Deconstructing Whiteness.\u201d The club, open to students from all five of the Claremont Colleges, aims to \u201cwork on owning our racism, deconstructing our Whiteness, and to engage in movement & action toward dismantling White Supremacy.\u201d \u000a\u201cWhite people at the 5C\u2019s: we\u2019re all racist. we\u2019re all microaggressive. [W]e are all not only complicit in, but actively perpetuating white supremacy,\u201d states an advertisement for the group. \u201cPretending that we are not racist and hoping that no one will discover our racism really doesn\u2019t cut it. [W]e need to ACTIVELY be doing work to deconstruct our whiteness (and holding our peers accountable in doing the same).\u201d \u000a\u201cRecognizing that White identity is a self-fashioned, hierarchical fantasy, Whites should attempt to dismantle Whiteness as it currently exists,\u201d explains the group\u2019s Facebook page, quoting Ian Haney López, a leading racial justice scholar. \u201cWhites should renounce their privileged racial character, though not simply out of guilt or any sense of self-deprecation. Rather, they should dismantle the edifice of Whiteness because this mythological construct stands at the vortex of racial inequality in America.\u201d\u000aThough the community is meant to be an open space for the discussion of students\u2019 Whiteness and its negative impacts on people of color, students within the group must be \u201cwhite people who believe white supremacy exists, whether [they] have owned that [they themselves] are racist or not.\u201d The founder of the group clarified that mixed-race students with a White parent would be able to attend, but only if they had the end goal of deconstructing their learned Whiteness. Additionally, White students who do not believe in White supremacy are not welcome. \u000a\u201cThe group is trying to address racism in the white community. We\u2019re not racist and we don\u2019t hate white people,\u201d wrote Kate Dolgenos, a senior at Pomona who joined the organization, in an email to the Independent. \u201cI\u2019m really happy this group has formed and I\u2019m excited to see what we\u2019ll do throughout the semester.\u201d\u000aNot all students are as enthusiastic, however. \u201cWhile I cannot comment on how the group intends to define and \u2018deconstruct\u2019 a white identity, as a cisgendered, politically liberal white male,\u201d Dalton Martin, a junior at Pomona, said, \u201cI feel this group may do less for persons of color rather than more. I feel that trying to codify and effectively martyr an image of white culture detracts from attempts to engage and stand in solidarity with marginalized identities.\u201d \u000aInternational students, too, found the group to potentially be harmful. \u201cOutside of the United States, being \u2018white\u2019 is not a unified and malignant identity,\u201d wrote one international student in an email to the Independent. \u201cI think their brash generalization invalidates the experiences of many people who would be considered White by their standards, which does not harmonize well with embracing one\u2019s own identity and self-love.\u201d\u000a\u201cWe\u2019ve Got Work To Do\u201d will soon be meeting to discuss their short- and long-term objectives as a community as to how to approach and handle their Whiteness, as well as how their Whiteness affects communities of color both on- and off-campus.\u000a_________________\u000aImage: Flickr\u000aShare this:Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)MoreClick to print (Opens in new window)Click to share on Pinterest (Opens in new window)Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)Click to share on Google+ (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Tags: Microaggression pc progressive racism Safe Space SJW White SupremacyCategories: Campus News

aS'Pomona College Resource Center Teaches Students Social Justice Buzzwords'
p383
aVOn Thursday night, the REACH (Revolutionizing Education, Advancing Collaborative Hxstories [sic]) committee of the Asian American Resource Center (AARC) organized an event called \u201cHow //Not// to Talk Like an Activist\u201d held at The Hive to teach students the definitions and usage of language used by social justice activists.\u000aThe event description states, \u201csometimes it\u2019s impossible to figure out what students at the Claremont Colleges are talking about, even when we\u2019re talking about things that everyone needs to understand. Join the AARC\u2019s REACH committee to discuss how we can break down activist language.\u201d The organizers added that the event will \u201cexplore key terms in describing social change and figure out how to make those terms accessible for ourselves and our communities,\u201d and affirmed that \u201cthis event is open to students at the 7Cs and centers students of color and allies.\u201d The event description also gave examples of what terms would be discussed: \u201cIntersectionality. Cisheteropatriarchy. Toxic masculinity.\u201d\u000aAccording to its description, the AARC \u201cworks in collaboration with other ethnic groups, academic department and campus offices to sponsor a wide range of educational endeavors.\u201d\u000aThe organizers started the event by stating that students sometimes \u201chear words tossed around and repeat them and sometimes we don\u2019t stop to think what they mean or about how we\u2019re using them to make our change-making ineffective or effective,\u201d adding that the \u201cgoal of this event is to break these terms down,\u201d referring to \u201ccommonly used buzzwords.\u201d The organizers emphasized that \u201cthey are not buzzwords to elevate ourselves above others, but\u2026ways to understand actual problems society has,\u201d and further stated that \u201cit\u2019s not bad that these are being more popularized\u2026but we want to use this event as a way to understand the historical roots of these terms.\u201d\u000aAttendees of the event then broke down into smaller groups to discuss definitions for the following words and phrases: intersectionality, identity politics, structural oppression, safe spaces, cisheteropatriarchy, toxic masculinity, white supremacy, and privilege. Participants tried defining those words in small groups before the actual definitions\u2014drawn from Harvey Mudd College, Columbia University, the Catalyst Project, and the blog Decolonize All the Things (D.A.T.T.)\u2014 were revealed.\u000aAccording to its website, the Catalyst Project believes \u201cthat racism is one of the fundamental forces keeping systemic injustice in place, and as white people we believe we have a strategic role to play in ending it.\u201d The author of D.A.T.T., in a description of his ideology, states that he is \u201cinterested in the complete liberation of all peoples from white patriarchy, capitalism, oligarchy, colonialism, settlement, as well as orientalism.\u201d\u000aExamples of definitions included \u201ca system of power based on the supremacy & dominance of cisheterosexual men through the exploitation & oppression of women and the LGBTQIA\u201d\u2014drawn from D.A.T.T\u2014for \u201ccisheteropatriarchy.\u201d \u201cPrivilege\u201d was defined as operating \u201con personal, interpersonal, cultural, and institutional levels and gives advantages, favors, and benefits to members of dominant groups at the expense of members of target groups\u201d\u2014based off a document from Harvey Mudd College\u2019s Office of Institutional Diversity.\u000aSamuel Breslow (PO \u201918) told the Independent that he thought \u201cthe event did a really good job of helping us be more cognizant about carefully articulating what we mean with the terminology we use,\u201d adding that \u201cit can be hard for us, as progressives, to have constructive discourse with conservatives when the social justice concepts that we refer to have been distorted and caricatured by Fox News to the point where they mean something totally different. Using words that have widely agreed-upon definitions can help us communicate more clearly with each other and can help avoid misunderstandings.\u201d\u000a_________________\u000aImage: Flickr\u000a \u000a \u000aShare this:Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)MoreClick to print (Opens in new window)Click to share on Pinterest (Opens in new window)Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)Click to share on Google+ (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Tags: Cisheteropatriarchy Privilege Safe Space Social Justice WarriorsCategories: Campus News

p387
aVWith 15 days to go, Hillary Clinton has cemented her position as the overwhelming favorite to win the election on November 8th.\u000aNationally, Mrs. Clinton has amassed a 6-point lead, according to this morning\u2019s RealClearPolitics average. In live voter surveys, which have been more accurate in past elections than online polls, the Democratic nominee leads Donald J. Trump by an average of about 10 points. Online and IVR1 polls show a tighter race, with Mrs. Clinton maintaining a 3-point advantage among those surveys.\u000aAfter the first presidential debate, Donald Trump lost traction in the most competitive states and has failed to recover. He now is underperforming 2012 Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney in nearly every battleground state, and his path through the Rust Belt\u2014long thought to be his best shot at victory\u2014has closed.\u000aMr. Trump is doing well in Ohio and Iowa, states where he holds a decisive demographic advantage. But in all-important Florida, where President Obama defeated Republican Mitt Romney by only 0.9 percent in 2012, Mr. Trump lags by four points. He also is behind in North Carolina, where Republicans won in 2012.

aS'A World That Never Changes'
p391
aVBecause world-changing ideas have to be brand new, they often come from people you wouldn\u2019t peg as \u2018world-changers.\u2019 These new ideas aren\u2019t going to be what most people think, so the person who comes up with them has to be a little outside the realm of most people \u2013 they have to be a little abnormal, just like their idea. If it was normal, then it wouldn\u2019t alter the world. And if the person was completely normal, they would not have cause to question what\u2019s commonly accepted. \u000aEven if someone has an earth-shattering idea, the strength of majority opinion makes implementing it difficult; not only did Galileo have to conceive a new way of understanding the universe, but he also had to find a way to surmount the Italian Inquisition. \u000aWhat\u2019s worse is when the world-changer is written off even before they have a chance to speak simply because society considers them useless. Even after escaping slavery and developing himself into a literary genius, Frederick Douglass still needed to defeat the common assumption that the color of his skin made him inherently valueless. \u000aThe measures society accepts to rid itself of \u201cundesirables\u201d are truly disturbing. \u000aDanish public opinion, for instance, considers Down syndrome a sign of worthlessness and 60% of Danes look forward to eliminating  Down syndrome in 2030 through subsidized abortions. Twelve years ago, the Danish government introduced free prenatal screenings. A year after the policy was enacted, the number of Danish babies born with Down syndrome halved. The Copenhagen Post now reports that \u201c[i]f current health policies and trends continue, Denmark could be a country without a single citizen with Down syndrome in the not too distant future.\u201d\u000aAs the Copenhagen Post observes, this is not an uncommon opinion in the US or the UK where 92% of all fetuses diagnosed with Down syndrome are aborted. In fact, there are whole groups dedicated to eliminating this and similar disorders in vivo. For example, the California Prenatal Screening Program\u2019s primary goal is \u201cto reduce the occurrence of birth defects and disability by offering prenatal screening and follow-up services to pregnant women in California.\u201d\u000aA similar practice is running rampant in India, where female babies are considered less valuable than males. Even after gender testing was outlawed, up to 4 million girls were aborted between 1991 and 2001, and a further 6 million by 2011, vastly outpacing the abortion of male fetuses. The ban is poorly enforced, and legal abortions make it possible for families to have sex-selective abortions. As in the case of Denmark, India is hardly alone in their behavior. According to Scientific American, sex-selective abortions were being considered as early as 1950.  Other societies which value women lower than men suffer from abortion-fed gender imbalances. In China, it has led to a spike in sex trafficking, notably of young girls. \u000aAll these nations fall into a larger pattern. There has never been a society in history without prejudices. So when it is legal to choose who deserves to live, society seems to inevitably target the marginalized and unwanted. This is why abortion has long been tied to eugenics in one form or another. Planned Parenthood was founded by a leading advocate of eugenics, Margaret Sanger, who believed it would be an integral part of the eradication of the \u201cunfit,\u201d and observed that, \u201cEugenics without Birth Control seems to us a house builded upon the sands. It is at the mercy of the rising stream of the unfit.\u201d \u000aAnd she was right that eugenics relies on birth control. Frederick Douglass faced terrible odds at birth, but he had a slim chance to prove mass opinion wrong. Through his perseverance, he was ultimately able to argue against the society that had devalued him and lived as irrefutable proof that they were wrong about his unworthiness. Aborted children have no such opportunity. If nearly every disabled child is aborted, they have no chance to prove their equal value and the incorrect assumption that they don\u2019t deserve to exist endures. \u000aRegardless of whether one thinks a fetus is human, the fact that abortion supports the elimination of the oppressed and helpless before they can even draw breath is sickening. Enacting such eugenics will prove detrimental to society\u2014such a society won\u2019t have many world changers. It will not include men like John Nash or Albert Einstein. No, their respective mental disorders would have cut their lives terribly short.\u000aAs genetic testing becomes more precise, where might this end? It is not difficult to imagine fetuses with ADD, dyslexia, anxiety, or bipolar disorder being systematically aborted. Even queer children could fall to the march of progress; scientists have long suggested that homosexuality can be linked to certain genetic markers. If these genetic markers can be identified before birth, might families choose to abort their queer or trans pregnancies before the child is born?\u000aSurely, the resulting society would be a cold and callous one: one in which a person\u2019s right to life depends on their social utility. Once put into place, it will likely stay that way.\u000a___________________________________________\u000aImage Source: Flickr\u000aShare this:Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)MoreClick to print (Opens in new window)Click to share on Pinterest (Opens in new window)Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)Click to share on Google+ (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Tags: Abortion dnc eugenics hillary clinton Privilege pro-choice pro-lifeCategories: Opinion

aS'Safe Spaces: Where Free Press Dies'
p395
aVIt is unbelievable how freedom of the press, a right our Founding Fathers so cherished, has eroded in a country that prides itself on its liberties. It is unbelievable how the right to cover an open event, which freedom of the press entails, cannot be practiced on college campuses.\u000aLast week, while trying to cover an open event discussing the role of the Asian-American and Pacific Islander (API) community in the Black Lives Matter movement, hosted by Pomona College\u2019s Asian American Resource Center (AARC)\u2014which considers itself a \u201csafe space\u201d\u2014I uncovered the sad state of free press at Pomona College. I was hoping to objectively cover this event, to bring out the little-known viewpoints of the API community on the Black Lives Matter movement. This hope was greeted by resentment and hostility, and I left with one message: Freedom of the press does not belong, and is not welcome, in safe spaces.\u000aThe process of stifling free press begins right as a journalist walks through the doors into the safe space. While I was initially welcomed when I asked if I could record the event and take notes, further questioning revealed I was trying to cover the event for a student-run publication. Even then, the event facilitators extended their warm welcome, until it was brought to light that this student-run publication was The Claremont Independent, a conservative-leaning paper. No more warm welcome and no more recording allowed, but I was still permitted to take notes.\u000aThe death blow of free press in this \u201csafe space\u201d struck later, when I started to take notes on my laptop just as the event began. As I finished typing my second line of notes, I was informed that note-taking would only be permitted if it was approved by all participants of the event\u2014if even one participant objected to my note-taking, I would not be allowed to take notes. Unsurprisingly, after a blindfold vote, at least one person voted against note-taking, and I was told to stop taking notes. I was told that taking notes made participants uncomfortable, and that I should respect the AARC as a \u201csafe space.\u201d In a subsequent meeting with the director of AARC, I was told the AARC functions primarily as a \u201csafe space\u201d where participants should feel comfortable, and that people\u2019s fears and concerns of an Independent journalist taking notes should be respected in this safe space, adding that the AARC does not want its views advertised to an audience the Independent could reach.\u000aDespite making it clear that speech at this event should make all participants comfortable, attacks on capitalism and \u201ccapitalist violence,\u201d the \u201cheteropatriarchal\u201d society, and traits of the \u201cmodel minority\u201d (like working hard and obeying the law) were left unchecked, without the slightest consideration of whether I, with differing political views, would feel comfortable listening to endless assaults to values which I hold dear. Yet with free press dead, who dares challenge this hypocrisy?\u000aIn the college campus \u201csafe space,\u201d with no freedom of the press, there is no check on the lack of ideological diversity, no way for \u201csafe spaces\u201d to promote their messages through an objective third party, and no way for the public to know about and effectively help pressure and protest against the hypocritical \u201cinclusiveness\u201d of safe spaces.\u000aFree press is the restraint that keeps \u201csafe spaces\u201d from becoming \u201chate spaces\u201d that do not fear whether the stifling of differing views, the silencing of people from different parts of the political spectrum, and the venting and promotion of anger towards certain groups of people, will ever be exposed to and critiqued by the public, where there is no fear whether the public will pressure them to change. Because, without the restraint of free press on safe spaces, the public will simply never know.\u000aUnless safe spaces are made accessible to the free press, journalists need to abide by a new rule concerning reporting in safe spaces: Don\u2019t try. Yet I remain confident, and hopeful, that through the efforts of those who act to uphold our Founding Fathers\u2019 values on college campuses, the rule for journalists will be \u201cDare to try. Dare to uphold and defend the diversity of opinion, freedom of expression, and freedom of the press.\u201d\u000aShare this:Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)MoreClick to print (Opens in new window)Click to share on Pinterest (Opens in new window)Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)Click to share on Google+ (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Tags: Free Press Free Speech inclusive pomona college Safe Spaces Trigger WarningsCategories: Opinion

aS'Claremont Students Say Masculinity is Hazardous to Mental Health'
p399
aVOn Monday night, 5Cs Thrive hosted an event called \u201cMasculinity + Mental Health.\u201d According to the event\u2019s description, the workshop focused on the mental health problems caused by masculinity.\u000a\u201cMasculinity can be extremely toxic to our mental health, both to the people who are pressured to perform it and the people who are inevitably influenced by it,\u201d state the event\u2019s organizers. \u201cWe would like to encourage discussion on how to openly talk about our emotions and our wellbeing, and how to engage in masculine identities in a healthy way. Relevant to this discussion is how masculinity can harm our relationships with people and one\u2019s ability to cope when relationships are difficult or end. We want to create a safe and open space where we can talk about masculinity and its various intersections with our identities and experiences.\u201d\u000a5Cs Thrive describes itself as \u201cA safe space for students at the 5c\u2019s to talk about mental health,\u201d and the \u201cMasculinity + Mental Health\u201d event took place at the Rick and Susan Sontag Center for Collaborative Creativity (The Hive). The Hive\u2019s stated mission is \u201cto accelerate the creative development of students across the 5Cs. We do that through Exploration \u2013 by creating a safe space to experiment and play, Collaboration \u2013 by bringing people with diverse backgrounds and perspectives together to be in the \u2018intellectual muck\u2019 together, and through Experiential Learning \u2013 thinking by doing.\u201d\u000aThe event received some positive feedback on Facebook. One woman, Lizbeth Ramirez, posted, \u201cTHANK YOU from the fullness of my heart for having this available for my fellow brothers.\u201d\u000aMiles Robinson (PO \u201918), who attended the event, told the Independent  that there was \u201ca common consensus that masculinity is harmful both to those who express it and those affected by it\u201d among attendees. \u201cIt was all talk through personal experiences,\u201d stated Robinson. Robinson added that all of the organizers of Thrive\u2014as well most of the attendees of Thrive\u2019s weekly functions\u2014are female, and the group hosted this event in the hopes of getting more men to come.\u000aIt seems Thrive\u2019s efforts were not entirely successful, as some students avoided the event out of concern that it would alienate men. \u201cIf masculinity is described as something negative\u2014a mental illness\u2014then this is sexism against men,\u201d stated Will Gu (PO \u201920) in an email to the Independent. \u201cSafe spaces\u2026 are supposed to make everyone feel comfortable. Criticizing masculinity makes males who adhere to traditional gender norms uncomfortable.\u201d\u000aUpdate: October 4, 2016\u000aSabine Scott, a leader of the \u201cMasculinity + Mental Health\u201d event, issued the following statement in an email to the Independent:\u000a\u201cOur \u2018Masculinity and Mental Health\u2019 event was created with the goal of providing a space to examine to effects of masculinity on mental health. In order to preserve the confidentiality of the space I\u2019m not going to disclose what was discussed, but it was a productive conversation that helped people explore how masculinity impacted each person\u2019s individual experience with mental health. Participants were able to find support in other people who have had similar experiences, and the meeting empowered both the men and women in the meeting to realize how the pressure to conform to stereotypical masculinity can have harmful effects on being able to share emotions and maintain healthy relationships.\u201d\u000aCorrection: October 5, 2016\u000aAn earlier version of this story stated that 5Cs Thrive was part of the The Hive. A representative from Pomona College stated in an email to the Independent that 5Cs Thrive is not affiliated with The Hive, they just used the venue for their event.\u000aShare this:Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)MoreClick to print (Opens in new window)Click to share on Pinterest (Opens in new window)Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)Click to share on Google+ (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Tags: Claremont Colleges Masculinity pomona college Safe Spaces SexismCategories: Campus News

p403
aVYesterday, On the Loose (OTL), the outdoors club of the Claremont Colleges, announced the cancellation of their annual speedo hike due to concerns regarding body positivity. The event, which had previously been one of OTL\u2019s most popular of the year, involved over one hundred students from the Claremont Colleges hiking up Mount Baldy in speedos.\u000a\u201cBy having the Speedo Hike as our official welcome event each year, we unintentionally sent the message that to participate in OTL, you must be fit and comfortable with your body image,\u201d OTL wrote on its Facebook page. \u201cThe name \u2018Speedo\u2019 itself inherently implies bro-iness. OTL is so much more than just that, but many potentially interested students get turned off to our club each year because of Speedo Hike.\u201d\u000aClarissa Worcester, a staffer at the Outdoor Education Center, added, \u201cthe publicity/legacy surrounding that of the speedo hike is immediately and inextricably ostracizing. Not to mention how it directly excludes individuals with religious dressing practices. No matter what work you do, the \u2018speedo hike\u2019 will manifest itself as OTL taking out and funding a group of students that is nearly guaranteed to be almost exclusively outdoor-experienced, fit, and heavily swayed in the direction of outdoor\u2014and otherwise\u2014privilege that OTL is trying to work against.\u201d Worcester added, \u201cOTL\u2019s decision to not put many folks\u2019 organizational effort and time into an event that is widely associated with bodily shaming/exclusion just seems to make a lot of sense.\u201d\u000aNot all students agreed with the decision. \u201cI want to express my profound disappointment in your decision to cancel the speedo hike. This decision is, in my opinion, a mistake that goes decisively against your responsibility as the heads of the club to enable transformative experiences in the outdoors,\u201d wrote Jeremy Snyder, a Pomona student. \u201cOTL should strive to serve as many people from as many backgrounds as possible, but this should be an additive process, not a reductive one. In terms of enabling outdoor experiences, taking the speedo hike off the docket is a net negative. No progress is made by its cancellation. If the hike is cancelled, every individual and group that would have opted not to participate will stay on campus that saturday just the same. The sheer absence of the Speedo Hike will not propel them outdoors, so it is not productive to that end. What does change, however, is that now every person who would have partaken\u2014for whom the speedo hike could have been a fun, challenging, and socially transformative experience as it was for my friends and I\u2014will now spend their saturday on campus as well, sedentary. The decision to cancel the hike has not propelled anybody new outdoors, it has merely erased the chance for students to have a new and singularly memorable experience.\u201d\u000aSamuel Breslow (PO \u201918) pointed out that attendees of Speedo Hikes in the past were never forced to don speedos. \u201cI think it\u2019s important to note that wearing a speedo was not a requirement for participation in the speedo hike,\u201d noted Breslow. \u201cI can also speak to it from personal experience: I decided to keep my clothes on (for comfort/in order to lessen the sunburn), and no one ever pressured me in the slightest to take them off.\u201d\u000a\u201cThis has been a difficult decision for us to reach. We know lots of our beloved members will be disappointed that Speedo Hike isn\u2019t happening this year,\u201d states OTL\u2019s Facebook page. \u201cIn an effort to make the club more inclusive and accessible to everyone, we didn\u2019t want to advertise a trip that our staff felt like wasn\u2019t representational of the full OTL mission and purpose.\u201d\u000a_______________\u000aImage: Flickr\u000a \u000aShare this:Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)MoreClick to print (Opens in new window)Click to share on Pinterest (Opens in new window)Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)Click to share on Google+ (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Tags: Body Image Body Positivity bro-iness Healthy at any size pomona college SpeedoCategories: Campus News

aS'The Only Part of Last Night\xe2\x80\x99s Debate You Need to See'
p407
aVYesterday\u2019s debate featured exactly the Trumpian performance we\u2019ve come to expect: the Donald\u2019s signature one-two punch of incoherence and lies, paired with enough bizarre non sequiturs\u2014\u201cI have a son who\u2019s 10, he\u2019s so good with computers,\u201d anyone?\u2014so as to border on the surreal.\u000aWith such a \u2018bigly\u2019 amount of sheer ineptitude, however, genuinely important debate moments are being forgotten. It\u2019s easy to miss the insanity buried amidst the absurd, the moments such as when Trump accused Clinton of fighting for her entire 68 years of life against an organization started in 2004. But one of Trump\u2019s less provocative monologues contains the most substantive policy revelation of the debate. It is a microcosm of the debate as a whole; if you don\u2019t have the time to watch the full debate, all you need to do to understand Round One of Trump v. Clinton is to read this three-paragraph transcript of the Republican nominee\u2019s response to the following question from moderator Lester Holt: \u201cOn nuclear weapons, President Obama reportedly considered changing the nation\u2019s longstanding policy on first use. Do you support the current policy?\u201d\u000aThe first paragraph seems innocuous at first: \u201cWell, I have to say that, you know, for what Secretary Clinton was saying about nuclear with Russia, she\u2019s very cavalier in the way she talks about various countries. But Russia has been expanding their\u2014they have a much newer capability than we do. We have not been updating from the new standpoint. I looked the other night. I was seeing B-52s, they\u2019re old enough that your father, your grandfather could be flying them. We are not\u2014we are not keeping up with other countries. I would like everybody to end it, just get rid of it. But I would certainly not do first strike.\u201d\u000aDid you catch it? After Trump\u2019s vague comments on Secretary Clinton, after Trump\u2019s incorrect statement on Russia\u2019s military capabilities, after Trump\u2019s rambling anecdote about B-52s? The part where Trump says he was in favor of a policy that the U.S. has not endorsed throughout the over 70 years in which nuclear weapons have been existent?  Yes, right there at the end, Donald Trump states that he would never use nuclear weapons unless another country had already done so\u2013a policy change that President Obama recently declined to enact, could signal American weakness, and of which Mr. Trump had previously spoken negatively. But in the next section, surely Mr. Trump must explain the rationale for his about face!\u000aNope.\u000a\u201cI think that once the nuclear alternative happens, it\u2019s over. At the same time, we have to be prepared. I can\u2019t take anything off the table. Because you look at some of these countries, you look at North Korea, we\u2019re doing nothing there. China should solve that problem for us. China should go into North Korea. China is totally powerful as it relates to North Korea.\u201d\u000aTrump tries to explain his reasoning, but what he says is so vague as to defy interpretation. What exactly is this \u201cnuclear alternative\u201d of which he speaks? When he says he \u201ccan\u2019t take anything off the table,\u201d is he referring to the nuclear first strike policy he renounced seconds earlier?\u000aWhat\u2019s frightening about these two passages is what\u2019s frightening about Trump and is emblematic of his performance in this debate. Trump tends to take fringe policy positions, and then indemnify himself from risk by making vague or contradictory statements so that he can change his narrative to fit the political mood du jour. This way, if his answer here is brought up in a critical way, he\u2019ll use the hemming and hawing that immediately followed his answer to justify whatever flip-flop he deems to be politically expedient. Or alternatively, Trump just gave the first answer that came to mind and then equivocated to fill his time because he didn\u2019t actually understand the question asked of him.\u000aOh, I almost forgot the third paragraph I mentioned; that\u2019s actually just the sentence that immediately follows from where we left Mr. Trump. \u201cAnd by the way, another one powerful is the worst deal I think I\u2019ve ever seen negotiated that you started is the Iran deal.\u201d\u000aThis passage is the scariest for hardcore Trump supporters. With their anti-immigrant sentiments, one can but wonder how they could ever bring themselves to vote for a candidate who can\u2019t speak English.

aS'What Is Killing American Politics?'
p411
aVTo find the greatest irony of this year\u2019s presidential election, look no further than any one of the national polls conducted since the final presidential primaries took place in June.\u000aMajorities of voters disapprove of and mistrust each major-party presidential nominee. Three-fifths of the electorate views Republican Donald Trump unfavorably, and less than one-in-three voters describe Democrat Hillary Clinton as \u201chonest and trustworthy.\u201d Third-party candidates\u2014little-known even to some of their most ardent advocates\u2014are earning historic levels of support. Libertarian Gary Johnson, who won less than one percent of the vote in his 2012 general election run, now regularly polls in the double-digits, backed by a ragtag coalition of millennial voters and political independents. And for the Republicans and Democrats who have decided to toe the party line in November, negative voting is more common than ever, with over half of Republicans and nearly as many Democrats viewing their votes more as opposition to the other party\u2019s nominee than as affirmative support for the candidate they have chosen.\u000aDissatisfaction with the American political process has spread to nearly every corner of the national fabric, and for some voters, the sense of disillusionment could not be stronger. According to an editorial which appeared this month in The Boston Globe, over a third of likely voters from both parties agree with the statement that \u201cthe election will be rigged.\u201d These are not wild-eyed conspiracy theorists who believe that their fellow Americans will cast more votes than the law allows. They simply have lost all faith in the system. For them, democracy has died. No matter their choice, nothing will change.\u000aIn reality, however, democracy is far from dead\u2014and therein lies the irony. Today, though voters almost entirely control whom the major political parties nominate, their dissatisfaction with the process and the candidates it produces has reachedrecord-breaking heights.\u000aThe 2016 presidential primaries granted voters near-total control over the selection of party nominees. The vast majority of Republican delegates were bound to vote for the winners of their states\u2019 primaries or caucus elections. In the case of the Democrats, a cadre of unbound superdelegates\u2014composed of party leaders and long-time party loyalists\u2014exists ostensibly to counter popular impulses, but it never does. In 2008, superdelegates threw their weight behind Illinois senator Barack Obama instead of their preferred candidate, Hillary Clinton, on account of the groundswell of popular support behind his campaign. This year, Hillary Clinton was the clear choice of Democratic Party voters, having won nearly four million more votes than Vermont senator Bernie Sanders over the course of the primaries. For the Republicans, Donald Trump won even more decisively, earning nearly six million more votes than his closest competitor to secure the nomination.\u000aFor both Democrats and Republicans, the modern presidential primary is democratic to its core\u2014a far cry from the mid-twentieth century, when this process first took shape. State party bosses dominated the old system, exerting power over their crops of convention delegates in order to sway the outcome in favor of their preferred candidates. The national conventions of yore were private affairs, taking place in the backrooms where public input was nonexistent. In the early decades of the twentieth century, some states began to enshrine primary elections into law, but it was not until the late seventies that the Democratic Party became the first to bind delegates, requiring each to vote for the candidate chosen by voters in his state\u2019s primary election. Before then, the results of primary elections were merely a suggestion for party leaders to consider\u2014or, more often, to disregard.\u000aStrangely enough, voters seem to recognize how much power they hold over party nominations. Though few participate in the primary elections as a percentage of the American population, turnout has surged across the board over the past decade. In 2008, the hotly contested race between Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama crushed turnout records in 23 states across the country and helped set a new record for primary election participation nationally. And this year, the G.O.P. has led the charge, with Republican turnout reaching its highest level \u201csince at least 1980.\u201d\u000aIf higher turnout is not sufficient to show that voters are getting what they bargained for during the presidential primaries, Donald J. Trump\u2019s nomination should be. The entirety of the political establishment aligned itself against Mr. Trump during the primary season, mounting a fierce challenge to his candidacy when it looked like he might actually win. But when the voters spoke repeatedly in favor of his candidacy, handing him victories everywhere from Florida to New York, there was no escape from the inevitable. Party leaders begrudgingly began to back Trump\u2019s campaign in late May, and by the start of the national convention in July, they were mostly united behind Mr. Trump. Republican National Committee chairman Reince Priebus squashed the last-minute efforts of some delegates to torpedo Mr. Trump\u2019s nomination at the convention and has spared no mercy for Republicans who continue refusing to support their party\u2019s nominee.\u000aSo we return to our dilemma. If voters are getting what they voted for, what can explain the pessimism of the American public about both major party candidates? The answer is political polarization.\u000aOne clue can be found in the partisan breakdowns of support for each candidate. Despite a virulent media narrative proclaiming rampant defections from members of his own party, Mr. Trump commands overwhelming support from Republicans. In early June, as the G.O.P.\u2019s bitter primary battle drew to a close, political analyst Harry Enten from FiveThirtyEight\u2014the brainchild of Nate Silver, the famed numbers guru\u2014indicated that \u201cRepublican voters are rallying behind Trump as if he were any other nominee.\u201d The same has held for Mrs. Clinton among Democrats, despite her early troubles converting Bernie Sanders\u2019s most progressive backers.\u000aPart of the reason for the remarkable show of unity within each party is the shrinkage of partisan coalitions. Over the past decade, as political parties have accelerated their shift away from the center, the percentage of Americans who identify with either party has shrunk considerably. According to Pew Research, nearly two-fifths of the country now call themselves political independents\u2014almost a 10-point increase from 2004. Over the same period, both political parties have watched their ranks shrink.\u000aThe Pew studies also reveal that Republicans and Democrats alike are doubling down on their most ardent constituencies instead of broadening their appeal. Even as the percentage of Americans identifying as Republican declined six points over the past decade, a majority of whites from the Silent Generation\u2014those born between the 1920s and \u201840s\u2014now call themselves Republicans. Similar gains are visible among evangelicals, two-thirds of whom now view themselves as Republicans or G.O.P.-leaners. Meanwhile, Democrats have increasingly come to rely upon college graduates and young non-white voters to compensate for lost support among whites and older Americans.\u000aThe consequences of these trends toward polarization and consolidation are two-fold. First, with the hardening of core constituencies and the loss of centrist voters, both parties have come to favor candidates who are more extreme relative to the center, speeding the exodus of moderates who could have balanced against this impulse toward extremism or, as many within the party would call it, ideological \u201cpurity.\u201d Second, moderate voters and independents increasingly seek alternatives to the major parties. Some of these voters tune out entirely, indirectly increasing the influence of partisans over nominee selection and general election outcomes. Others turn toward third-party candidates. In a poll from early September, Libertarian Gary Johnson took first place among independents who do not lean toward either party, besting Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton by seven points.\u000aAmericans have lost faith in their democratic institutions for good reason. With both major parties fleeing the center, more voters have been left behind than ever before, and this year, they are locked into a false choice between two awful candidates.\u000aWhen creating the Constitution of the United States, our nation\u2019s framers built a system of checks and balances in order to control the worst impulses of government. When one branch grows too strong, others may control it. In politics of today, however, the checks upon the two-party system have failed. By catering to their core constituencies at the expense of middle America, the Republican and Democratic parties have insulated themselves from the moderating force of independent voters, taking advantage of their long-time place as the central actors in American politics to force upon voters an impossible choice between two extremes.\u000aTo create balance again, independent voters must exercise their considerable political power and rebel against this system. Third-party threats have produced some of the most extraordinary and important political transformations in American history\u2014including the victory of the anti-slavery movement under Abraham Lincoln, the first president and the father of the Republican Party.\u000aFortunately, ending gridlock in Washington will not take a Lincoln. A strong third-party movement, drawn from a broad, deep coalition of disaffected partisans and political independents, could put enough pressure on the two-party monopoly to force them to the center\u2014or to carve out just enough space for a new party, a moderating force in American politics.\u000a________________________________________________\u000aImage: Flickr\u000aShare this:Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)MoreClick to print (Opens in new window)Click to share on Pinterest (Opens in new window)Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)Click to share on Google+ (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Tags: 2016 election Hillary Johnson National Politics polarization POTUS third party TrumpCategories: Opinion

aVAfter insisting for weeks that concerns about the health of Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton are the work of alt-right conspirators and endemic sexism within the Republican Party, the Clinton campaign found itself in the merciless grip of reality after an unsettling \u201cmedical episode\u201d at a 9/11 commemoration forced the campaign to disclose that Mrs. Clinton was diagnosed with pneumonia on Friday.\u000aOn Sunday morning, Hillary Clinton attended an event in New York City marking the fifteenth anniversary of the September 11th terrorist attacks, accompanying a raft of other dignitaries which included her Republican opponent, Donald Trump. According to The New York Times, she remained there for a little over an hour before she \u201csuddenly\u2026left her position\u201d and departed the event in a black SUV. After over an hour of silence from the Clinton campaign, which did not permit any members of the press to follow the candidate as she departed, campaign spokesperson Nick Merrill indicated that Mrs. Clinton merely felt \u201coverheated\u201d and needed to take some time to recover at her daughter\u2019s Manhattan apartment.\u000aBut as the media firestorm surrounding the strange incident reached a fever pitch, gaining traction well beyond the confines of the conservative blogosphere, the Clinton campaign released a statement from the candidate\u2019s personal physician revealing that Mrs. Clinton had been diagnosed with pneumonia, a relatively common but occasionally deadly respiratory condition, on Friday.\u000aThe decision to reveal the ostensible reality of Mrs. Clinton\u2019s condition comes at a high price. Not only will this admission tether concerns about the Democratic nominee\u2019s health to the political mainstream, it will complicate Mrs. Clinton\u2019s efforts to earn the trust of an electorate which has increasingly come to see her as deceitful and corrupt. A new ABC News/Washington Post poll released early Sunday morning shows that only a third of Americans view Mrs. Clinton as \u201chonest and trustworthy,\u201d and this incident will only shrink this minority further. Indeed, Sunday\u2019s events have highlighted once more the compulsion of Mrs. Clinton and her campaign to lie to the American people about matters of profound importance, especially when the truth could incur a political cost.\u000aMost crucially, the episode throws into sharp relief the true magnitude of the dishonesty of Mrs. Clinton\u2019s campaign. As Mrs. Clinton gleefully took to the stage and the late night circuit to mock concerns about her health as \u201cconspiracy theories\u201d and the \u201cparanoid fever dream\u201d of her Republican opponent, she sought a secret rendezvous with her doctor in order to diagnose a condition serious enough to require \u201ctwo Secret Service agents\u201d to hold her up\u2014her feet \u201cdragging\u201d on the ground, according to The New York Times\u2014and \u201choist\u201d her into her getaway car.\u000aAfter spending weeks condemning the \u201cderanged conspiracy theories\u201d of \u201cthe Republican nominee for president,\u201d putting surrogate after surrogate on national television to assure the public that Mrs. Clinton is perfectly healthy and to declare that any suggestion to the contrary is sexist, the Clinton campaign had invested far too much into its web of deceits to stop. It took a shocking public demonstration of Mrs. Clinton\u2019s frail condition\u2014not the medical diagnosis which came two days earlier\u2014for her campaign to admit the truth.\u000aThis is unacceptable conduct for a person seeking elected office, but for Hillary Clinton, it is just the cost of doing business. Sunday\u2019s incident reinforces an unfortunate reality about Mrs. Clinton: that only under the force of law or the weight of unbearable political pressure will the woman seeking to become our nation\u2019s next president dare to tell the truth.\u000a_____________________________________________________________\u000aImage: Flickr\u000aShare this:Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)MoreClick to print (Opens in new window)Click to share on Pinterest (Opens in new window)Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)Click to share on Google+ (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Tags: 2016 election hillary clinton National PoliticsCategories: Opinion

aS'Editorial: The Importance of Free Expression'
p423
aVFree speech on campus has become a growing issue in the US and internationally as traditionally freer countries place more and more restrictions on speech. As students and journalists at the Claremont Colleges, we have seen the negative repercussions of this trend firsthand\u2014in our classrooms, jobs, places of worship, and even in our coffee shops. \u000aIt\u2019s sad what this culture has cost the colleges. We live in a community of bright, engaged students, but fear of radical left wing retribution too often stifles conversations before they start. We are fortunate to study under great professors but, going forward, the quality of many of our tenured faculty will be subject to how well a given professor fits into the Social Justice Warrior mold. Even our peers\u2019 charitable efforts fall prey to the expanding reach of political correctness. \u000aIt\u2019s our job as students to shape the community here on campus, but the administration has the power to set the tone and step in when our peers or teachers abuse their power. Too often, our administrations are compliant or even complicit in the destruction of our community\u2019s cohesion and intellectual growth.\u000aYet last Thursday, President Chodosh and Dean Uvin stood up in favor of our rights in an email released to Claremont McKenna College\u2019s student body and alumni. The email outlined the administration\u2019s commitment to protecting free speech on campus, both inside and outside the classroom. By defending students\u2019 and faculty members\u2019 right to think and speak freely, Claremont McKenna College\u2019s administration has made an important pivot away from the increasingly sensitive culture of censorship and toward a more positive academic community. This will serve students well both in Claremont and outside the bubble. \u000aCMC\u2019s announcement is a strong first step, and we\u2019re hopeful that the administration will take this policy seriously in order to provide students with a well-rounded intellectual environment. We now call on the administrations at Pitzer College, Scripps College, Pomona College, and Harvey Mudd College to adopt the University of Chicago\u2019s policies on speech as well. The Claremont Colleges have a great capacity to influence the world around us, but that can\u2019t happen unless we are allowed to grow as thinkers and as people. We cannot overstate the importance of free expression on campus. Without it, education is impossible.\u000aSteven Glick, Editor-in-Chief\u000aMegan Keller, Publisher\u000aDaniel Ludlam, Managing Editor\u000aShare this:Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)MoreClick to print (Opens in new window)Click to share on Pinterest (Opens in new window)Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)Click to share on Google+ (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Tags: Censorship Claremont McKenna Cultural Appropriation Free Speech Harvey Mudd Microaggressions Pitzer Pomona Safe Spaces Scripps Trigger WarningsCategories: Editorial

aS'#BlackLivesMatter Makes Martyrs Out of Criminals'
p427
aV \u000aNot a month goes by without Black Lives Matter dubbing another Black American a martyr of the fight for Black equality. This month, their martyrs are Sylville K. Smith and Korryn Gaines: two armed, long-time criminals who resisted arrest. Smith, a man with a lengthy rap sheet, was pulled over at a traffic stop and fled his car while armed with a stolen gun in an area with poor police-civilian relations. Gaines was fatally shot two weeks ago after threatening to kill police officers who arrived at her house with a warrant for her arrest. Gaines pointed a Mossberg 12-gauge shotgun at the responding officers who did not shoot her initially. Using her gun and her five-year old son as a human meat-shield, she presented enough of a threat to the police that a SWAT team was deployed to her house and ultimately shot and killed her.\u000aBlack social media, The Huffington Post, and other Leftist, Afrocentric news sources have spun these stories as evidence of White supremacy and \u201csystemic racism.\u201d Violent protests erupted Saturday night in Milwaukee, Smith\u2019s hometown. The protesters destroyed businesses and targeted White people for beatings while chanting Black Lives Matter slogans. Black Lives Matter and its supporters have decided that any African-American shot by a cop or a White civilian\u2014regardless of circumstance or just cause\u2014is a martyr. Almost all of these \u201cmartyrs\u201d have been just like Smith and Gaines: violent criminals who threatened an officer\u2019s life.\u000aHere are the unadulterated stories of BLM\u2019s other heroes:

aS'The Safest Space in Claremont'
p431
aVMy senior year of high school, I established a safe space. Of course, at that point in my life, I had never heard the phrase \u201csafe space,\u201d so I called it the Gay-Straight Alliance. At its best, the GSA was a family for kids who did not otherwise have a supportive community. And in my tiny rural high school, there were a lot of queer kids who needed family.\u000aStill, the GSA struggled to be everything those students needed. It\u2019s hard to build a community that consistently cares for its members. Regardless of their circumstances, people in a group tend to prioritize their standing in the group above the wellbeing of others. And, in many ways, safe spaces come engineered to make that worse. They are supposed to be somewhere members can be emotionally vulnerable and open. So, usually, the leadership is given the power to remove bullies who would pounce on that vulnerability.\u000aThe only problem is that this often gets abused.\u000aA friend of mine started a GSA-like organization at her college freshman year and it imploded. New leadership were verbally abusive towards bisexual and pansexual students before ruling to ban them from meetings completely. Since these students could \u201cpass as straight,\u201d they were considered just as threatening to the group\u2019s \u201csafety\u201d as straight people. In reality, their identities just made them easy to bully.\u000aThat safe space, like far too many do, allowed no room for dissenting views. The appointed leaders dictated the common good, what was right and wrong, who was pure and who was dangerous. No one could defend the outcasts, for fear of being deemed sinful themselves.\u000aSo I didn\u2019t seek out a safe space my first year at Claremont. I visited the Queer Resource Center when I toured the colleges, but I never came back. The staff seemed nice and there were certainly times I could have used a community. I just didn\u2019t think I would find it there, seeing as I was conservative, Christian, and\u2014most importantly\u2014fond of speaking my mind.\u000aThen, last year, my friend dragged me to a 3CIV bible study. I had my misgivings. The people seemed nice but, again, I wasn\u2019t sure I\u2019d fit in. 3CIV is a branch of InterVarsity serving CMC, Scripps, and Harvey Mudd and as such is an Evangelical organization. I was raised as an Episcopalian, which is about as different you can get from InterVarsity stylistically and theologically without being Catholic. I figured I could get past the lack of hymns and stained glass, but did not think they\u2019d be able to move beyond my opinions on scripture. Particularly, I didn\u2019t think they\u2019d get past me identifying as bisexual.\u000aI wouldn\u2019t have really blamed them if they didn\u2019t allow me to join. After all, the QRC and other liberal groups on campus wouldn\u2019t have accepted me for my political and religious views. It wasn\u2019t any stranger for an Evangelical to think my choice to act on my sexual identity made me intolerable. And my personal experience with Evangelicals told me that\u2019s what I should expect.\u000aThen 3CIV blew my expectations apart. No matter how many points we disagreed on, no matter how much I pushed back, this group still treated me like someone with a soul. They prayed with me, talked with me, and welcomed me in as a member of their community. When I talked about my own experiences with homophobia, this Evangelical bible study listened to me and loved me.\u000aThat kind of unconditional care set the standard for all of our meetings. I was safe to disagree with someone and they were safe to disagree with me. Consequently, I had some of the best conversations I\u2019ve ever had about healthy relationships and queerness with members of that evangelical bible study.\u000aI was equal parts shocked and horrified last April when the Associated Students of Harvey Mudd College (ASHMC) decided to withdraw 3CIV\u2019s funding on the grounds that it discriminated against LGBTQ students.\u000aAccording to Carla Becker, ASHMC Senate Chair, while 3CIV welcomes anyone as a member, it requires that its official student leaders \u201cexemplify Christlike character, conduct and leadership,\u201d referring to several biblical passages, including 1 Corinthians 6: 7-11. Among other things, the passage states, \u201cFornicators, idolaters, adulterers, male prostitutes, sodomites, thieves, the greedy, drunkards, revilers, robbers \u2013 none of these will inherit the kingdom of God.\u201d Accordingly, leaders must agree that sex outside of a monogamous, heterosexual marriage is immoral. If they disagree, they are asked to step down as official leaders but are still welcome as members.\u000aSo, ASHMC explained, in February, two Harvey Mudd leaders of 3CIV were asked to step down: one because of his views on the eternal nature of Hell and the other because of their perspective on sex outside of heterosexual marriage. According to Ms. Becker, \u201cThe leaders agreed to step down, but a friend of the members thought the action\u2026discriminatory and went against the nondiscriminatory statement ASHMC requires in the charter of all ASHMC chartered clubs\u2026 This sparked discussion in the senate about whether or not leaders of religious clubs can be held to certain beliefs.\u201d\u000aThat discussion is still ongoing as ASHMC holds a closed subcommittee this summer to decide exactly what it thinks. For 3CIV, this discourse has already had negative consequences.\u000aOn April 17, 3CIV requested $1000 in scholarship funds to send Mudd students to InterVarsity\u2019s regional summer conference and \u201c[a] senate member then motioned to give 3CIV $0 for the conference. The motion was seconded\u2026 The same senate member read [Corinthians 6: 7-11], mentioned cases of discrimination they had heard about from past LGBTQ member(s) of 3CIV, and mentioned a booklet published by InterVarsity on how parents can prevent homosexuality.\u201d On April 24 the motion passed with 5 in favor, 4 opposed, and 3 abstentions. Though the alleged mistreatment of LGBTQ students was discussed, ASHMC\u2019s decision ultimately hinged on the idea that 3CIV forces leaders who disagree with its stance on sex to step down.\u000aThe only problem is that isn\u2019t factually true. According to the head of 3CIV, Kate Vosburg, \u201c3CIV leaders are not asked to step down if they disagree with the belief that sex outside of marriage is immoral.  However, they are asked not to teach against this belief.  In the last 11 years I\u2019ve been with 3CIV, we have not asked any leader to step down because of their personal beliefs about sex.\u201d\u000aGranted, this could just be a sizable mistake on ASHMC\u2019s part, but it\u2019s fairly large oversight and that makes me wonder why 3CIV came under fire at all. The idea that club leaders should represent their clubs\u2019 ideals is not unusual. No one balks if the leader of a young republicans club is required to be a republican. \u000aASHMC\u2019s behavior could be warranted if 3CIV were a particularly hateful organization. Though the leaders in 3CIV have much less power than, say, the leaders of my friends\u2019 GSA, they still could be guilty of abusing it. However, the evidence indicates that is simply not true.\u000aThe leaders who were asked to step down in February did so amicably. When asked to comment, one of the ex-leaders, Nathaniel Leslie, said he did not feel discriminated against and commented: \u201cI disagree with some of the organization\u2019s theology and the way that they go about spreading it. However, I regard all of the people in 3CIV very highly. They are some of the kindest people that I have ever met.\u201d\u000aThe other former leader, who wished to remain anonymous, stated:\u000a\u201cI think 3CIV is a great resource for a lot of Christians on campus, but it sadly does not represent all denominations of Christianity, nor does it claim to. Next year, with the support and good wishes of 3CIV, a few friends and I are going to work on creating another Christian group at Mudd that does not align itself with any denomination, in hopes to provide a welcoming place for Christians of all backgrounds, as well as anyone who is interested in exploring the Christian faith.\u201d\u000aUnfortunately, ASHMC chose to withhold the names of the students who allegedly experienced discrimination within 3CIV so I cannot comment on their experience, but judging only from my own I would be surprised if 3CIVers treated queer students unlovingly.\u000aSo it seems to me that the crux of the issue is not how 3CIV treats students or the construction of their charter, but probably ASHMC\u2019s own prejudice against evangelical Christianity. \u000aIf that\u2019s the case, it wouldn\u2019t be terribly surprising. I love 3CIV now, but a year ago I would have assumed they were unfriendly towards queer. And I certainly wasn\u2019t alone in that prejudice. Colleges are notoriously unfriendly towards religion and outright hostile towards evangelical Christians, who suffer state-sponsored oppression nationally for expressing their views.\u000aHowever, what matters now is what ASHMC does to remedy their mistake. Come this fall, ASHMC will review whether or not to recognize 3CIV\u2019s charter. Their decision will not be just a matter of free speech and religious liberty. It will help determine our campus culture. \u000aIn reality, 3CIV succeeds where the POC-only discussions and online forums, my friends\u2019 GSA, and every other segregated \u201csafe\u201d space fails. Despite the increasingly common persecution of evangelical Christians, 3CIV opens its arms to every single student like a sister, comforts them like a mother, and strengthens them in the way a family should.\u000aCorrections: The piece previously asserted that 3CIV asks leaders to step down if they disagree that sex outside of marriage is immoral and that the Asian Pacific Islander Support Program At Mudd only accepts Asian Pacific Islanders. Additionally, the articled stated that Students for Middle Eastern Cultural Promotion and the Society of Hispanic Professional Engineers are live organizations at Harvey Mudd.\u000aThese statements have been adjusted since this story\u2019s initial publication.\u000aShare this:Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)MoreClick to print (Opens in new window)Click to share on Pinterest (Opens in new window)Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)Click to share on Google+ (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Tags: Christianity Free Speech Harvey Mudd ReligionCategories: Opinion

aS'Pitzer College VP Defends Racist RAs Despite College President\xe2\x80\x99s Condemnation'
p435
aVAfter several national media outlets covered Pitzer College student leaders\u2019 defense of racially discriminatory housing practices, both the incoming President of Pitzer College, Melvin Oliver, and the Vice President for Student Affairs, Brian Carlisle, issued statements to the entire student body, faculty, and staff.\u000a\u201cRecently, an article in local media quoted Facebook comments made by Pitzer students regarding their preference in race for their roommates in non-Pitzer housing. Specifically, the post indicated that only people of color should inquire about the housing option,\u201d President Oliver stated in his first-ever email to the Pitzer College community. \u201cWhile Pitzer is a community of individuals passionately engaged in establishing intracultural safe spaces for marginalized groups, the Facebook post and several subsequent comments are inconsistent with our Mission and values.\u201d\u000a\u201cPitzer College\u2019s Mission is to create engaged, socially responsible citizens,\u201d Oliver continued. \u201cWe come together to live and work in a shared learning environment where every member is valued, respected, and entitled to dignity and honor. Our shared goal is to create a balanced approach to engaging complex intercultural issues, not to isolate individuals on the basis of any protected status.\u201d\u000aShortly after incoming President Oliver sent out his email condemning students who refuse to live with certain people based on the color of their skin, Vice President Carlisle reached out to the Pitzer College community with a different message. \u201cOur dedicated resident assistants have been targeted by Twitter trolls who publicly defame them and attack their contributions to our community,\u201d Carlisle wrote. \u201cNow, more than ever, is the time to come together as a community to celebrate and support our amazing resident assistants and student affairs staff. Please join me in thanking them for their work in furthering our mission and for keeping our campus a safe place to work, live, and study.\u201d\u000aStudents were unimpressed with the administrators\u2019 inconsistent responses. \u201cI think it\u2019s important that our administration takes a firm stance on this. What we saw in those Facebook posts and comments was a disdain for a certain group of people, in this case, white people. If Pitzer wants to stay consistent with their values of racial harmony and multiculturalism, they must speak out against comments like this,\u201d stated Nick Toro (PZ \u201918). \u201cWhat\u2019s even more important than racial diversity is the diversity of thoughts and ideas. Only then can we learn to understand each other.\u201d\u000aShare this:Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)MoreClick to print (Opens in new window)Click to share on Pinterest (Opens in new window)Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)Click to share on Google+ (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Tags: Pitzer College racismCategories: Campus News

aS'Students at Claremont Colleges Refuse to Live with White People'
p439
aVA group of students at the Claremont Colleges are in search of a roommate for next year, but insist that the roommate not be white. Karé Ureña (PZ \u201918) posted on Facebook that non-white students in need of housing arrangements should reach out to either her or two other students with whom she plans to live in an off-campus house. The post states that \u201cPOC [people of color] only\u201d will be considered for this living opportunity. \u201cI don\u2019t want to live with any white folks,\u201d Ureña added.\u000aDalia Zada (PZ \u201918) expressed concerns to the anti-white discrimination. \u201c\u2018POC only?\u2019 Maybe I\u2019m missing something or misunderstanding your post, but how is that not a racist thing to say?\u201d\u000a\u201cThis is directed to protect POC, not white people. Don\u2019t see how this is racist at all\u2026\u201d responded AJ León (PZ \u201918). Sara Roschdi (PZ \u201917), a Pitzer Latino Student Union member, stated, \u201cPeople of color are allowed to create safe POC only spaces. It is not reverse racism or discriminatory, it is self preservation.\u201d\u000a\u201cWe don\u2019t want to have to tiptoe around fragile white feelings in a space where we just want to relax and be comfortable,\u201d commented Nina Lee, a Women\u2019s Studies major. \u201cI could live with white people, but I would be far more comfortable living with other poc.\u201d\u000a\u201cWhite people always mad when they don\u2019t feel included but at the end of the day y\u2019all are damaging asf [as f*ck] and if a POC feels they need to protect themselves from that toxic environment THEY CAN! Quick to try to jump on a POC but you won\u2019t call your friends out when they\u2019re being racist asf,\u201d noted Terriyonna Smith (PZ \u201918), an Africana Studies major and Resident Assistant (RA) for the 2016-2017 year. \u201cI\u2019m not responding to NO comments and NOPE I don\u2019t wanna have a dialogue.\u201d It is not clear whether or not this refusal of dialogue represents the approaches to conversation on racism with fellow students encouraged by professors of Africana Studies or the Residence Life staff at Pitzer College.\u000aAnother Resident Assistant and Black Student Union member, Jessica Saint-Fleur (PZ \u201918) added to the thread of comments, \u201cWhite people have cause [sic] so much mf [motherf*cking] trauma on these campuses \u2026 why in the world would I want to live with that? Bring that into my home? A place that is supposed to be safe for me?\u201d\u000aThe Mission and Values section of Pitzer College\u2019s website states, \u201cIntercultural Understanding enables Pitzer students to comprehend issues and events from cultural lenses beyond their own,\u201d and adds that \u201c[Pitzer College] supports the thoughtful exchange of ideas to increase understanding and awareness, and to work across difference without intimidation. We have the right to be heard and the responsibility to listen. Communication, even at its most vigorous, should be respectful and without intent to harm.\u201d\u000aEdit: An earlier version of this story stated that AJ León was a member of the Pitzer College Latino Student Union.\u000a______________\u000aImage: Flickr\u000aShare this:Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)MoreClick to print (Opens in new window)Click to share on Pinterest (Opens in new window)Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)Click to share on Google+ (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Tags: Claremont Colleges Pitzer College POC racism Safe SpacesCategories: Campus News

aS'Why I Can\xe2\x80\x99t Vote for Hillary Clinton'
p443
aV \u000aOn July 5th, F.B.I. Director James Comey announced that the bureau would not recommend criminal charges against Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton for mishandling classified information during her time as President Obama\u2019s secretary of state. However, he also castigated Mrs. Clinton for her \u201cextremely careless\u201d treatment of our nation\u2019s secrets and, at a later congressional hearing, said that her early statements on the matter were \u201cnot true.\u201d\u000aBut last week, in an interview on Fox News Sunday, Mrs. Clinton recalled Mr. Comey\u2019s words rather differently. \u201cDirector Comey said that my answers were truthful,\u201d she said, \u201cand [that] what I\u2019ve said is consistent with what I\u2019ve told the American people.\u201d\u000aThis statement is plainly false. So false, in fact, that it earned \u201cFour Pinocchios\u201d\u2014a rating reserved for \u201cwhoppers\u201d\u2014from fact checkers at The Washington Post. But no matter: Mrs. Clinton and her various campaign surrogates continue to peddle this fiction at every turn in the apparent hope that doing so will make her misconduct disappear. In the meantime, the incredulity of those paying even the slightest attention has grown to astonishing proportions. As one television host put it, \u201cit\u2019s like they don\u2019t think we have video tape.\u201d\u000aMrs. Clinton\u2019s willingness to lie with impunity\u2014even as she faces one of the weakest general election candidates ever fielded by either party\u2014is disturbing. Her first instinct at the onset of this email debacle should have been to take responsibility for her actions, laying out the full truth for the American people. Not only would this course of action have been the right and honest one to take, it would have been politically prudent. Mrs. Clinton could have defused this controversy at the outset and moved on, simply by being forthright.\u000aBut instead, she has deceived the American people over and over again, hiding behind complex, legalistic non-explanations of her private email server designed to thoroughly confuse those trying to make sense of her unacceptable conduct. What makes it so hard for Mrs. Clinton to tell the truth, even when the political cost of doing so would be negligible?\u000aThere are only two possible answers. Either Hillary Clinton is unable to bring herself to acknowledge publicly that she willfully mishandled classified information, or she knows that there is much more to the email story\u2014the revelation of which would compromise her candidacy. In either case, Mrs. Clinton cannot earn my vote.\u000aDonald Trump is odious. His irresponsible rhetoric, unconstitutional policy proposals, and his inability to handle criticism like an adult are all part of the reason why I will not cast my ballot for him this November. But just as Mr. Trump cannot help himself when he lashes out at the parents of a slain Muslim Army captain, Mrs. Clinton cannot suppress her compulsion to lie, even when doing so can only tarnish further her extensive career in public service.\u000aThat Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Trump are each unfit for the presidency is the main reason why both candidates have appealed to fear rather than pressing a positive case for their own selection. But I reject this notion that I must choose a liar over a blowhard, or vice versa, because one might be \u201cworse\u201d than the other. My vote is an affirmative endorsement of the person for whom it is cast; it must be earned.\u000aIt is for this reason that when I submit my ballot this November, I will vote for neither major party candidate. Instead, I will vote for Libertarian candidate Gary Johnson. Though I do not agree with Mr. Johnson on many central issues, both Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Trump fail to meet even the minimum standards of honesty and decency which we have come to demand from our public servants.\u000aI\u2019m sick and tired of the lies, gamesmanship, and crudity in politics. I can\u2019t vote for a vulgarian, but neither can I cast my ballot for the dishonesty and dysfunction which Hillary Clinton represents.\u000aShare this:Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)MoreClick to print (Opens in new window)Click to share on Pinterest (Opens in new window)Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)Click to share on Google+ (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Tags: donald trump Gary Johnson hillary clinton Political CorrectnessCategories: Opinion

aS'Pitzer College Offers Full Scholarship for \xe2\x80\x98Undocumented\xe2\x80\x99 Students'
p447
aVIn 2012, just months after American college student-loan debt ballooned to over one trillion dollars, Pitzer College began offering a scholarship specifically for illegal immigrants from Latin American countries. \u201cWe, every single year, offer one full-ride scholarship to an undocumented student who resides [illegally] in California\u2026 It\u2019s called the Arnaldo Rodriguez scholarship, and all of the information can be found on our website,\u201d Pitzer College admissions counselor JR Ramsey told the Independent. The school\u2019s website states, \u201cPitzer College established the Arnaldo Rodriguez Scholarship in honor of the college\u2019s former Vice President of Admission and Financial Aid\u201d because of an experience Rodriguez had \u201cmeeting a high school student who was at the top of her class and had lived in the US all her life but didn\u2019t qualify for any financial aid due to her undocumented status.\u201d\u000aThe Pitzer College website states, \u201cthe need-based, four-year scholarship is awarded to top-performing students of Latin American descent who attended high school in California and are not citizens or permanent residents of the United States.\u201d These students also must fit a certain ethnic profile. \u201cFor people of full European descent, unfortunately [the scholarship] doesn\u2019t apply,\u201d Ramsey said. It follows from this that African and Asian students, too, are unqualified for the award, but Ramsey did remark \u201cif you\u2019re part-Latino, you\u2019re fine\u201d and \u201cif you\u2019re in DACA categorization, that still counts.\u201d\u000aThe scholarship covers the costs of full-time tuition, student activities fees, housing, school-provided medical insurance and a meal plan. In total, this sums up to around $70,000 per year\u2014more than a quarter of a million dollars over the course of an undergraduate education. The largest and only merit-based scholarship given by Pitzer, the Trustee Merit Scholarship, offers $5,000 per academic year\u2014a tiny fraction of the amount given to undocumented immigrants\u2014and does not increase with hikes in tuition and student fees as the Rodriguez scholarship does.\u000aUndocumented applicants to Pitzer who do not receive this unique scholarship offer are treated the same as international applicants when considered for standard financial aid. \u201cIf your high school counselor is willing to put in a good word for you\u201d in order to help an applicant receive this special scholarship, Ramsey stated, \u201cthey can shoot an email to Santiago Ybarra, the director of our office. It\u2019s perfectly fine for them to reach out and talk about all the things you do in the community, the things you do in school, and why they think you\u2019d be a great applicant not only for Pitzer, but also for what is embodied by that scholarship.\u201d\u000aRamsey noted that few Pitzer students are undocumented. \u201cWe only have the flexibility to offer one scholarship [per year] through that fund,\u201d he said, \u201cbut I will go ahead and insert a little plug for Pitzer while I\u2019m on the phone with you and say even outside of the admission process, I think [undocumented students] find a lot of support here at Pitzer. The culture of our campus here helps students of that categorization thrive academically.\u201d\u000aShare this:Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)MoreClick to print (Opens in new window)Click to share on Pinterest (Opens in new window)Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)Click to share on Google+ (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Tags: Illegal Immigrants Illegal Immigration Pitzer College Tuition Undocumented ImmigrantsCategories: Campus News

aS'Ted Cruz is Not An \xe2\x80\x98American Hero\xe2\x80\x99'
p451
aVIn his speech to the Republican National Convention, Texas Senator Ted Cruz delivered a much-needed refresher course on his party\u2019s values: liberty, freedom of speech and religion, and the right of citizens to keep more of what they earn. And yet, after he outlined the reasons why a Republican needs to win, Cruz declined to support his party\u2019s nominee, declaring that Republicans should \u201cvote their consciences\u201d in November rather than throw their support to Donald J. Trump. His statement was met with the deafening boos of an arena full of grassroots conservatives. Cruz\u2019s words were not meant to encourage the GOP to support Trump in November; they were a betrayal, a clear nod to the failed #NeverTrump movement.\u000aSticking to your principles is admirable. Not endorsing someone who violates them also deserves praise. But refusing to endorse the nominee in a prime time speech at the convention looked petty. If Cruz did not wish to compromise his principles, he should have stayed home\u2014like several of his fellow ex-candidates\u2014and accepted the consequences of remaining on the sidelines.\u000aThe problem is, Cruz\u2019s reasons for not endorsing Donald Trump were unrelated to principle. In an address the next morning to the dismayed Texas delegation, Cruz defended his non-endorsement by saying that he is \u201cnot in the habit of supporting people who attack my wife and attack my father.\u201d This argument\u2014legitimate though it may be\u2014cheapened Cruz\u2019s statement of principle the previous night.\u000aTed Cruz\u2019s convention speech was drafted out of personal pique, not out of fidelity to principle. Failing to endorse the nominee because of a personal insult completely undermines Cruz\u2019s claim that his dedication to conservative principles\u2014principles which Trump will better serve as commander-in-chief than will Clinton\u2014is what is stopping him from endorsing Trump\u2019s candidacy.\u000aTrump should have apologized for the ridiculous things he said about Cruz and his family during the primaries. But Cruz should have moved past the personal insults for the sake of party unity. Cruz\u2019s critique of Hillary Clinton \u2014and his affirmation of conservative principles\u2014was compelling enough to justify an endorsement of just about any Republican, even Donald Trump.\u000aFurthermore, Cruz\u2019s action worked to undermine any long term benefit Cruz might have gotten by putting principle above party. Betting that Trump will either lose or be a failed one-term president, Cruz was trying to set himself up for a 2020 run, just as Ronald Reagan did following his loss of the nomination to President Gerald Ford at the brokered convention of 1976.\u000aThe key difference between these two situations is that Cruz did not lose at the convention, and the image of party unity is important\u2014it\u2019s the main reason the leadership tries to avoid brokered conventions in general. So Cruz, not possessing the same precedent (or charm) as Ronald Reagan, outed himself as a political opportunist. As Charles Krauthammer put it, \u201cWhat Cruz delivered was the longest suicide note in American political history.\u201d\u000aAlready, there are rumors of primary challenges ahead for Cruz. On Tuesday, Joaquin Castro, one of the liberal Castro brothers, announced that he would be looking to run for Cruz\u2019s seat. Donors angry about Cruz\u2019s self-serving stand at the convention may not be willing to step in to help him dispatch these threats.\u000aThe delegates, the Trump campaign, and the RNC were livid with Cruz\u2019s performance, but the #NeverTrumpers were thrilled. The D.C. insiders and intellectuals who find Trump unacceptable hailed Cruz as an \u201cAmerican Hero.\u201d Leaders of the movement tweeted their approval and offered to back him in a third party run.\u000aThose leaders had their chance to support him, of course, when he was in second place against Trump, and their support could have led to a different outcome. But he was \u2018too religious\u2019 or otherwise unattractive for them when it mattered. People who had never even considered voting for Cruz in the primary suddenly applauded his \u201cprincipled\u201d stand against Trump and the GOP establishment.\u000aCruz came off as a sore loser, not a statesman. By allowing his animosity toward Trump to guide his convention address, the Texas senator sold his party short\u2014and his career even shorter.\u000a_______________\u000aImage: Flickr\u000aShare this:Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)MoreClick to print (Opens in new window)Click to share on Pinterest (Opens in new window)Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)Click to share on Google+ (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Tags: donald trump election RNC ted cruzCategories: Opinion

aS'How #BlackLivesMatter Failed Black America'
p455
aVAs a Black college student, I have felt immense pressure from other Black students to choose between joining the insular, single-minded Black community and being seen as a traitor. Being mixed-race has made it even more difficult, as both my Black identity and loyalty to my race are questioned when I express my views. I am quite openly proud to be Black, but I do not fit\u2014and refuse to ever fit\u2014into the mold built by the self-indulgent Black community here at the Claremont Colleges; I would rather be labeled a \u201cshady person of color\u201d or a \u201ccoon\u201d by my Black peers than validate their insecurities and inaccurate opinions which have fostered such dysfunction and divisiveness within the Black community.\u000aBlack Lives Matter has been nothing short of a hindrance for Black people, especially those who do not subscribe to the fallacious narrative that America is a bastion of hostile White supremacy. In its constant bid for media attention, the group has blocked traffic on major highways, hijacked political rallies, disrupted college speakers, and, since last summer, have on a continuous basis preached anti-cop rhetoric. In the aftermath of the murders of police officers in Dallas and Baton Rouge, members of the group broke into a police officer\u2019s house and praised the Dallas police massacre.\u000aBlack Lives Matter\u2019s statistical illiteracy, specious rephrasing of events to fit their melodramatic narrative, and constant screaming when they do not get their way not only depicts Black Lives Matter as a movement of emotion-driven ideologues, but also paints all Black people as less credible.\u000aBlack Lives Matter also reinforces White superiority. In fact, it thrives on it. The movement as a whole operates and feeds solely on garnering guilt and pity from White people, which plays directly into the false idea that Blacks are inferior to Whites. As Dr. Michael Hurd has said, \u201cPity is based on the premise: \u2018Your vulnerability allows me an opportunity to be superior.\u2019\u201d Once Black Lives Matter \u201cwins\u201d and the inferiority complex it promotes is satisfied, we as a people will fall decades behind in the fight for cultural equality.\u000aThe Black Lives Matter movement vilifies and punishes potential allies who aren\u2019t \u201cdoing enough\u201d for their cause, rather than embracing a constructive discourse. They block White students from their events and refuse to listen to any student who disagrees with them on even the smallest details. Black Lives Matter has become a discriminatory organization which only serves to whip the Black community into a frenzy, and it is only a matter of time before students on campuses radicalize and hold violent demonstrations like those which destroyed Baltimore and Ferguson.\u000aWhat little central organization Black Lives Matter maintains has embraced militancy and the dream of rebuilding the Black liberation movement\u2014a movement which secured its place in history largely through the lengthy rap sheets of FBI most-wanted terrorists, cop killers, and professional rioters who served as its leaders. Prominent Black Lives Matter leaders support mob actors who loot as a form of activism, such as Joanne Chesimard\u2014better known as Assata Shakur\u2014who killed a state trooper and committed multiple robberies, who flaunted opinions entertaining race war, and who believed that violence was an acceptable means to a greater end.\u000aSome have disregarded the actions of these Black Lives Matter supporters as unrepresentative of the movement at large. But with no meaningful effort within the movement to expunge violent actors from its ranks, the organization has become a safe harbor for incitement, murderous rhetoric, and what can only be described as domestic terrorism. In fact, as defined by the federal government, Black Lives Matter fits within the definition of a domestic terrorism group under all terms of Section 802 of the U.S. Patriot Act. Despite this, a petition posted on the White House website to recognize Black Lives Matter as a terrorist organization was recently dismissed.\u000aAdvocates of the movement cannot pick and choose who they think represents Black Lives Matter; the organization has to claim responsibility for any and all actions taken under its name. In present day Black activism, Black Lives Matter members are responsible for not only the Dallas police shooting, but also for anti-police chants such as \u201cPigs in a blanket, fry \u2018em like bacon!\u201d and \u201cWhat do we want? Dead cops! When do we want it? Now!\u201d These violent slogans aim to intimidate the public, discourage police officers from doing their jobs, and threaten those who might stand in the way of the Black Lives Matter movement.\u000aIf Black Lives Matter really wants to make a positive difference for Black lives, they have to start by addressing the realities they have chosen to ignore. Black men alone have made up 40% percent of all cop killers in the last decade despite comprising only 6% of the population. They are also eighteen-and-a-half times more likely to kill a cop than a cop is to kill them. According to FBI crime statistics, Black people (both juvenile and adult) commit 51% of America\u2019s murders, nearly 30% of rapes, 56% of robberies, and 33% of aggravated assaults. Despite these high violent crime rates, Blacks make up only 26% of police shootings. Black Lives Matter loves to complain about the \u201cdisproportionate killing of Blacks,\u201d but a recent study from Harvard University confirmed that police shootings have no racial bias.\u000aAny good work that Black Lives Matter has done for the Black community is overshadowed by the movement\u2019s promulgation of anti-police, anti-White, and sensationalist sentiments. Beyoncé, a number of the parents of those shot (such as those of Michael Brown), and even Barack Obama have been ignored as they called for peaceful protest. Black Lives Matter must begin renouncing their violent members and setting the course for a new era of harmony and trust between minority communities and our nation\u2019s law enforcement.\u000a_______________\u000aImage: Flickr\u000aShare this:Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)MoreClick to print (Opens in new window)Click to share on Pinterest (Opens in new window)Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)Click to share on Google+ (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Tags: Black Lives Matter pomona college RaceCategories: Opinion

aS'How Bernie Sanders Saved Super PACs'
p459
aVFrom the very beginning of his presidential campaign, Bernie Sanders has assailed the undue political influence of millionaires and billionaires, who he says have rigged the system in their favor through profligate contributions to super PACs and political campaigns. Yet the remarkable success of his unconventional candidacy has proven quite the opposite: that a democratic, grassroots political campaign can thrive without the helping hand of big money donors.\u000aWhen Bernie Sanders announced his candidacy in April of last year, he was not considered a serious player in the national political scene. His polling average had not yet ventured beyond single digits, and nearly half of Democrats did not know enough about him to respond to poll questions mentioning his name. But his anti-establishment message resonated with voters almost immediately. In the 24 hours following his entry into the presidential race, he raised $1.5 million, outpacing better-known politicians like Republicans Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz and earning nearly every dime from small-dollar donations.\u000aIt was not long before Mr. Sanders became a real competitor, nearly winning the Iowa caucuses and dealing a crushing 22-point defeat to Hillary Clinton, the chosen candidate of the political establishment, in New Hampshire\u2019s primary election. He out-raised and out-spent Mrs. Clinton throughout the first four months of 2016, the critical stretch during which nearly three-quarters of all Democratic pledged delegates were allocated. To date, Mr. Sanders has raised over $200 million in campaign contributions, with about three-fifths of that number coming from donations of $200 or less.\u000aBy every traditional metric, despite shunning the support of progressive super PACs, Bernie Sanders\u2019s political campaign was an unmitigated financial success. His most ardent supporters, however, miss the irony of this accomplishment. If the campaign finance system were rigged\u2014if it were in fact designed to suppress the voice of the people and to channel the influence of millionaires and billionaires\u2014Mr. Sanders would have failed.\u000aBut he did not. Rising from virtual political anonymity, Bernie Sanders fiercely challenged the Democratic frontrunner and singlehandedly pushed his message about income inequality and political corruption to the forefront of the national consciousness. And it is not as if Mr. Sanders had no opportunity to win his party\u2019s nomination. As the Washington Post reported last week, close advisers to the Sanders campaign\u2014as well as the Vermont senator himself\u2014have chalked up his loss not to a rigged campaign finance system or the corrupt political elite but to \u201cmissed opportunities, a failure to connect with key constituencies and stubborn strategy decisions.\u201d\u000aBernie Sanders is evidence enough that our campaign finance system is functioning just as it should. It rewards candidates like Mr. Sanders, who bring a message and personality that resonates with voters across the country, and punishes those who cannot build enough support to survive. Strict limits on contributions made directly to political campaigns ensure that floundering candidates are unable to lean on wealthy benefactors to keep them afloat, and the law already carries serious penalties for coordination between political campaigns and super PACs, which may raise unlimited sums of money in support of a candidate only if they maintain complete independence.\u000aBernie Sanders has proven that the campaign finance system works. And in so doing, though his sharp criticism of independent expenditure groups was central to his candidacy, Mr. Sanders may have saved the very campaign finance institutions he so passionately condemned.\u000a \u000a_______________________\u000aImage Source: Flickr

aVRecent general election polls have revealed that voters dislike both Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton to an unprecedented degree, but Mr. Trump has opened up a considerable lead among independent voters\u2014who rate Mrs. Clinton poorly on her trustworthiness\u2014and has made significant gains with millennials. According to a recent ABC News/Washington Post survey, Mr. Trump has improved his standing with millennial voters by 17 points, which puts him neck-and-neck with his Democratic opponent among young people.\u000aThat young voters are not overwhelmingly supportive of Mrs. Clinton at this point in the race is a major cause for concern. Strong millennial support provided a major boost to President Obama in close swing states, where turnout among young voters approached 60 percent, the largest in recent history. Millennials also comprise a reliably liberal segment of the electorate and have become more liberal in recent elections. Pew Research surveys conducted in 2014 revealed that a majority of millennials lean toward or identify with the Democratic Party, whereas only about a third see themselves as Republicans or conservative-leaners. And in the 2012 presidential election, President Obama crushed Mitt Romney by 37 points among young voters, while John Kerry in 2004 only managed to muster a 10-point victory against Republican George W. Bush among the same demographic.\u000aPresident Obama did a remarkable job of whipping up enthusiasm among millennial voters in 2008 and 2012. But Mrs. Clinton is neither youthful nor charismatic, traits that made President Obama a powerful turnout driver. In many ways, she is the exact opposite of the person she seeks to replace. Where Mr. Obama had scarcely served a single term in the U.S. Senate prior to becoming president, Mrs. Clinton has spent her entire life in public service, building an extensive\u2014but dull\u2014resume over decades of work in government. And where Mr. Obama pressed a campaign message built on platitudes of \u201chope and change,\u201d his former secretary of state has pinned her aspirations for the presidency to appeals to policy details and political expertise. Coupling Mrs. Clinton\u2019s blasé public persona and detail-driven campaign strategy with the growing public perception that she is untrustworthy, it becomes increasingly clear that a millennial generation frustrated with the gridlock and opacity of today\u2019s political world is unlikely to warm to her candidacy as it did to Mr. Obama\u2019s. In one striking poll taken in late April, though 61 percent of millennials pledged their support to Mrs. Clinton in a one-on-one matchup with Donald Trump, over half viewed her unfavorably. These numbers\u2014which have since soured considerably\u2014portend a depressed turnout among young voters and are illustrative of the dearth of enthusiasm among millennials for her candidacy.\u000aIndependent voters are even more important, having decided presidential elections for decades, but Mrs. Clinton trails her Republican opponent badly among these voters. One poll found that Mrs. Clinton\u2019s net favorability rating\u2014the percentage of voters who view her favorably subtracted by the percentage who do not\u2014among independents was an abysmal -51 points, while Mr. Trump\u2019s stood at only -17 percent. Without a significant improvement to her favorability numbers among this critical segment of the electorate, Mrs. Clinton will struggle to win over moderates and will likely suffer a stinging defeat in November.\u000aSelecting Bernie Sanders as her running mate will resolve both of these problems. On the favorability front, the Vermont senator is the only candidate whom more voters like than dislike. In a Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll taken in mid-May, his net favorability rating among registered voters was +7 points, while those of Mr. Trump and Mrs. Clinton were -29 and -20 points respectively. And contrary to the argument often made by his critics, these positive sentiments are not simply the result of Mr. Sanders\u2019s relatively low name recognition among the general election electorate. Among survey respondents who expressed strong feelings about the candidate\u2014those who view Mr. Sanders in either a \u201cvery positive\u201d or a \u201cvery negative\u201d light\u2014the Vermont senator is just about even, while Mr. Trump (-31 points) and Mrs. Clinton (-25 points), by the same metric, are intensely disliked. And crucially, Mr. Sanders\u2019s likability would help the candidate command strong support from independents in a general election campaign. According to a CBS poll taken this month, Mr. Sanders would win a majority of independents in a one-on-one matchup against Mr. Trump. Though the power of his appeal to independent voters would certainly diminish as a mere vice-presidential candidate, Mr. Sanders\u2019s presence on the ticket would convey a powerful endorsement of Hillary Clinton and bring his progressive, independent base of supporters to the ballot box in November.\u000aA Clinton-Sanders ticket would also ignite the passion of millennials who distrust the former secretary of state and find themselves in lockstep with Mr. Sanders on policy matters. Mrs. Clinton has utterly failed to draw young voters to her fold. In the Pennsylvania primary, where she won by double-digits, Mr. Sanders drew 83 percent of support among voters aged 18-29. And in a one-on-one national contest with Donald Trump, he crushes the real estate mogul by over 40 points within this same age group, while Mrs. Clinton cannot even secure a majority of youth support.\u000aThese remarkable levels of support indicate that millennials trust Mr. Sanders to represent them and strongly identify with his anti-establishment message. The septuagenarian senator, impassioned and vigorous on the stump, has railed against the \u201cmillionaire and billionaire class\u201d for attempting to turn government policy to its advantage and has proposed several drastic campaign finance reforms designed to sharply limit the influence of big money donors in elections. Along these same lines, Mr. Sanders has denounced the growing income inequality which exists in the United States, demanding that the wealthy pay more in taxes in order to fund a significant expansion of government aid and safety net programs, and advocates for a national single-payer health care program which would provide comprehensive medical coverage to every American family for free. For young progressive millennials, Mr. Sanders\u2019s policy proposals are bold steps to repair a political and economic system which is stacked against them at every level, while Mrs. Clinton\u2019s\u2014though also politically liberal\u2014appear pusillanimous by comparison. Nowhere is this perception more validated than in the contrast between the Democratic candidates\u2019 plans to increase the minimum wage. Where Mr. Sanders has campaigned ferociously for a 15 dollar federal minimum wage, Hillary Clinton supports a less ambitious increase to 12 dollars per hour.\u000aTo many of Mr. Sanders\u2019s supporters, Mrs. Clinton selecting Bernie Sanders as her running mate would amount to a tacit endorsement or\u2014at the very least\u2014an acknowledgement of the progressive ideas the Vermont senator has pressed throughout the course of his political campaign. It would also signal openness to taking up some of his proposals and including them among the central foci of Mrs. Clinton\u2019s general election campaign. As the Vice Presidential nominee, Mr. Sanders would have a platform from which to continue hammering on the main messages of his own campaign, and his community of donors\u2014most of whom are small-dollar donors who so far have given far less than the federal contribution limit\u2014would provide Mrs. Clinton with yet another source of funding for the general election campaign.\u000aChoosing Mr. Sanders would have its drawbacks. First, it is unlikely that the Vermont senator, who has built his candidacy on a critique of the moneyed political elite and super PACs, would be able to convince his most devoted supporters to vote for Mrs. Clinton, who has built her entire career and much of her wealth on the back of her and her husband\u2019s formidable political machine. Some of Mr. Sanders\u2019s backers would inevitably criticize him as a sell-out for associating himself with Mrs. Clinton and would refuse to support any kind of unity ticket. It is important to note, however, that these people are a small minority within Mr. Sanders\u2019s base of support and would be drowned out by the vast majority of supporters who view their candidate favorably and would be glad to see him have some say over policy decisions as the vice president in a Clinton White House.\u000aSecond, Mr. Sanders\u2019s radical policy positions might alienate some right-leaning moderate voters, who would otherwise view Hillary Clinton as an acceptable alternative to Donald Trump. But considering how unfavorably moderates view Mrs. Clinton at the present time, choosing someone as likable as Mr. Sanders is just as likely to produce the opposite effect and make her look better to this group of voters.\u000aBroadly speaking, Bernie Sanders provides balance to the Democratic Party ticket in a way other candidates will not. Playing it safe and selecting a relatively unknown old-school Democrat\u2014someone like Virginia Senator Tim Kaine or Labor Secretary Tom Perez\u2014will only isolate Mrs. Clinton on the ticket and throw her most unlikable qualities into sharp relief. Similarly, selecting a young candidate such as Julian Castro\u2014the current U.S. Secretary of Housing and Urban Development\u2014would be unnecessarily risky, as there is no telling just how much voter enthusiasm and millennial support such a candidate, who has not been vetted on the national stage and is nationally unknown, can ultimately produce. By contrast, Mr. Sanders has proven his ability to fire up the progressive base of the Democratic Party and millennials, who have eagerly embraced his populist rhetoric and have turned out for him to a degree rivaling the unprecedented groundswell of youth support for then-Senator Obama in the 2008 presidential election. He would also contribute a strong, relatively well-known personality to the ticket, one that would help compensate for Mrs. Clinton\u2019s glaring lack of charisma.\u000aIf Hillary Clinton wishes to mount the most serious challenge possible to Donald Trump in November, she would do well to select the only candidate who can effectively neutralize her most glaring flaws as her running mate. That candidate is Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.\u000aShare this:Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)MoreClick to print (Opens in new window)Click to share on Pinterest (Opens in new window)Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)Click to share on Google+ (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Categories: Opinion

aS'Could Trump Actually Win?'
p471
aVOne of the enduring critiques of Donald Trump from conservative Republicans throughout the primary process has been that the businessman\u2019s cocksure temperament and draconian immigration policy proposals, though popular among certain segments of the Republican primary electorate, will all but ensure his defeat in a general election campaign against Hillary Clinton, the presumptive Democratic Party nominee. I have levied this criticism against Mr. Trump in the past; after all, his approval ratings among women and Hispanics are awful and are unlikely to improve dramatically before voters cast their ballots in November, even if the businessman makes a concerted effort to soften his image within these critical demographic groups.\u000aBut since Donald Trump took his place as the presumptive Republican nominee, the long succession of general election polls which showed the real estate mogul trailing both of his potential rivals by a wide margin has been completely overturned. Before Mr. Trump\u2019s decisive victory in Indiana\u2019s primary on May 3rd forced Ted Cruz and John Kasich out of the Republican nomination fight, the GOP frontrunner was polling badly against both potential Democratic opponents. General election polls taken in the month of April showed Mr. Trump trailing Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders by an average of just about 10 and 12 percentage points, respectively. By contrast, in April 2012, Mitt Romney, who ultimately became the Republican nominee for that year\u2019s presidential election, only lagged President Obama by an average of five points across seventeen general election polls.\u000aBut in the polls taken after his ascendance to the status of presumptive nominee, Donald Trump has gained ground rapidly. Though Bernie Sanders still trounces him by an average of 9.4 percent, Mr. Trump has closed what was a double-digit gap between him and Mrs. Clinton to a mere 1.2 point margin. Taking only the polls conducted in the last week, the businessman pulls ahead of Mrs. Clinton, albeit by less than one percent on average. Yet remarkably, these same polls show Mr. Trump to suffer still from the same likability problems which his critics and opponents have identified. According to a Fox News poll conducted this week, Mr. Trump is disliked by nearly three-fifths of the national electorate, yet he still manages to defeat Mrs. Clinton by three points. What gives?\u000aFirst, though voters still dislike Mr. Trump immensely, they like him more now than they have in the past. Two months ago, the percentage of voters which view him negatively reached 65 percent, a record high for the duration of Fox News\u2019s general election polling so far in this election. In the most recent survey, this number declined to 56 percent. This change could be reflecting a number of factors, including Mr. Trump\u2019s move toward more moderate policy stances and less strident rhetoric as he shifts toward a general election strategy.\u000aSecond, Republicans are beginning to dutifully unite behind Mr. Trump as their party\u2019s nominee. According to Gallup, which has tracked the businessman\u2019s favorability among registered Republicans and Republican-leaning independents since July 2015, conservative voters are now more united behind him than ever, with two-thirds viewing him favorably now. Though many Republicans remain dissatisfied with Mr. Trump as their party\u2019s nominee, they still largely plan to support him, and the once powerful #NeverTrump movement is now greatly diminished in strength and resolve.\u000aThird, voters view Hillary Clinton as a poor alternative to Mr. Trump. According to this week\u2019s Fox News poll, over three-fifths of the electorate\u201461 percent\u2014view her unfavorably, while only 56 percent view Donald Trump in this way. Among independents, which have been a decisive force in the past several presidential contests, Mrs. Clinton\u2019s favorability rating is atrocious, with a whopping 51-point gap between voters who view her favorably (23 percent) and those who do not (74 percent). Independents also dislike Mr. Trump, but his net favorability (-17 percent) is much better than Clinton\u2019s. The former secretary of state also fares poorly on questions of trustworthiness, as many voters view her as the epitome of a slick career politician. Nearly half of voters view her as more corrupt than Mr. Trump, including nearly a fifth of Democrats.\u000aFourth, it is becoming increasingly unclear whether Mrs. Clinton will manage to unite the Democratic Party behind her candidacy. Though she has received strong support from registered Democrats in several recent surveys, what really matters is whether she will be able to woo Bernie Sanders\u2019s supporters\u2014best characterized as liberals who do not identify as Democrats\u2014to her cause. But as relations between Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Sanders have soured, her favorability rating among the Vermont senator\u2019s following has cratered. According to a YouGov poll conducted early this month, 61 percent of Mr. Sanders\u2019s supporters view Mrs. Clinton unfavorably, and only 55 percent said that they would vote for Clinton over Trump in November. Of course, much can change between now and the November election, and we will undoubtedly see Sanders\u2019s supporters shift at least slightly toward Hillary Clinton once she clinches the nomination. But unlike Mr. Trump, whose base of support largely consists of disaffected working-class people of independent political persuasions, Mrs. Clinton draws most of her support from older voters who identify themselves with the Democratic Party.\u000aThis difference could ultimately prove fatal for Clinton\u2019s campaign. It has long been the case that party identification is one of the best predictors of how people will vote. As one study of voting behavior in the 2008 election explains, \u201cparty identification is a perceptual screen: a pair of partisan-tinted eyeglasses through which the voter views the political world.\u201d As such, it goes without saying that Mrs. Clinton will command most of the vote from Democratic Party-affiliated voters in November. But this portion of the general electorate is one which virtually any Democratic nominee would win anyway simply by virtue of his/her party affiliation. The real battle is for moderates and independent voters, who are agents of transformation in an otherwise static political arena, yet these voters do not like Mrs. Clinton at all.\u000aDonald Trump is much better positioned in this respect. Though many Republicans are uneasy about his candidacy, their loyalty toward GOP-affiliated candidates will pull them inexorably toward their party\u2019s nominee. Meanwhile, Mr. Trump will hold onto his core group of supporters\u2014the powerful bloc of independent blue-collar voters which his candidacy has energized\u2014for the November election.\u000aFor months, I and many political pundits believed that Donald Trump would be a weak general election candidate. But as the general election matchup between Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Trump has solidified, it is becoming increasingly uncertain just who exactly is the underdog in this year\u2019s fight for the highest office in the land.\u000a_____________________\u000aImage Source: Wikimedia Commons\u000aShare this:Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)MoreClick to print (Opens in new window)Click to share on Pinterest (Opens in new window)Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)Click to share on Google+ (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Tags: Clinton donald election 2016 Hillary matthew reade TrumpCategories: Opinion

aS'Student Leaders: Diversity Proposal Remedies \xe2\x80\x9cUnsafe Academic Environments\xe2\x80\x9d'
p475
aVUnder pressure from student leaders, the Pomona College faculty voted last week to include a consideration of a professor\u2019s \u201cattent[ion] to diversity in the student body\u201d in the College\u2019s criteria for promotion and tenure.\u000aThe move follows the circulation of an open letter in support of the addition which received hundreds of signatures and the backing of several high-level officials in the College\u2019s student government, including the current and former Student Body Presidents. According to the letter, the new language will ensure that faculty members must demonstrate a sufficient commitment to \u201cdiversity, equity, and inclusion\u201d in order to be a successful candidate for tenure, promotion, or reappointment.\u000aThe letter also praised the motion as a significant step toward the realization of Pomona College\u2019s diversity objectives as laid out in a document released last year by the President\u2019s Advisory Committee on Diversity. According to the letter, the new criterion will help to alleviate the \u201cunsafe academic environments\u201d which have had a deleterious effect upon \u201cstudents\u2019 well-being and everyday lived experiences\u201d by making diversity one of the top considerations for faculty advancement, thereby recognizing that \u201cmeeting the needs of a diverse student body\u201d is \u201can essential component of exceptional teaching and service.\u201d\u000aUnder the former guidelines for promotion and tenure, faculty members were required to demonstrate \u201cintellectual leadership\u201d (i.e. \u201cgood teaching\u201d); \u201cprofessional achievement\u201d (i.e. scholarly productivity); and \u201ceffective service to the College,\u201d its student organizations, or to professional organizations. The new guidelines qualify \u201cgood teaching\u201d as teaching which \u201cis attentive to diversity in the student body\u201d and adds a requirement that faculty members seeking promotion should demonstrate competency or excellence at \u201cfostering an inclusive classroom\u201d in addition to the superior teaching skills which the College\u2019s promotion criteria already mandate.\u000aPotential candidates for advancement also must \u201cspecifically address their efforts to create and maintain an inclusive classroom.\u201d These efforts might involve, as the new guidelines suggest, the \u201cinclusion of scholarly and other works emerging from the perspectives of underrepresented groups\u201d in the courses taught by the candidate or \u201cany other classroom practices that support inclusivity and diversity.\u201d\u000aStudent reaction to the change has been generally positive. The open letter in support of the new language has garnered hundreds of signatures from Pomona College students. \u201cI support this criteria,\u201d said one supporter, who asked to remain anonymous. \u201cI appreciate the lengths to which the campus faculty and student body went in order to get input and consensus from so many people before implementing this criteria.\u201d\u000aOthers, however, are less pleased with the new policy. \u201cProfessors should be hired and later given tenure because of their teaching abilities,\u201d another Pomona student told the Independent. \u201cWhen it comes to promotion, identity politics should be left at the door.\u201d\u000aShare this:Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)MoreClick to print (Opens in new window)Click to share on Pinterest (Opens in new window)Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)Click to share on Google+ (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Tags: diversity inclusive pomona college Safe SpaceCategories: Campus News

aS'Is Hillary Clinton the Best Choice for Republicans?'
p479
aVAfter his win in Indiana, Donald J. Trump has become the GOP\u2019s presumptive nominee for President of the United States. Republicans should be genuinely fearful of what will happen to their party if Mr. Trump manages to win the general election. A Trump presidency would exacerbate the rift in the Republican Party between populists and the establishment, lead to Republican losses in the 2018 midterms and the 2020 presidential election, and turn a generation of young people away from conservative ideals. If you are a Republican who is thinking of holding your nose and voting for Trump, or even just staying home come election day, you should reassess your options. You should do what just a few months ago you would have considered unthinkable: casting your ballot in November for Hillary Rodham Clinton.\u000aA lot has changed since Jeb(!) Bush was the Republican frontrunner. First, a stark divide has emerged in the Republican Party between \u201cestablishment\u201d conservatives and those who feel that they have been left behind by their party and the modern economy. These economically marginalized voters disdain free trade because it has disadvantaged them individually, decry immigration because it has resulted in a loss of jobs in their industry, and view the ongoing liberalization of American culture as moral backsliding.\u000aThese Republicans are dangerous to the party for two reasons. First, they will contract rather than expand the Republican Party\u2019s appeal. Their harsh, often xenophobic rhetoric on immigration and trade has increasingly alienated the growing contingent of minority voters in the country, the support of whom Republicans need to cultivate if they hope to win future elections. Surveys taken by Univision when Marco Rubio, Ted Cruz, and John Kasich were still in the race showed Trump with the worst unfavorability rating among the Hispanic electorate than any of the other three Republicans. The same surveys showed Trump losing the Hispanic vote to Secretary Clinton by a whopping 57 percent.\u000aIt does not have to be this way; after all, Hispanics have the same distribution of ideological beliefs as the general population. Yet Hispanics who identify as conservatives generally still vote for the Democratic Party. These people should fit naturally within the Republican Party, but the divisive rancor which Trump has brought to the surface in the policy matters which matter most to them has discouraged them from embracing the conservative movement. Putting this harsh rhetoric on the back burner by defeating Mr. Trump would enable Republicans to focus on their outreach to these groups and create a powerful new force in the GOP.\u000aSecond, the views of \u201cTrump conservatives\u201d are anathema to young people. For better or for worse, young people are future voters, and they view PC culture much more favorably than do those who are older. There is certainly a debate to be had about whether PC culture has gone too far, but Republicans must be aware that having a presidential candidate who makes sexist remarks, advocates discriminating against a class of people based on their religion, and fails to immediately disavow David Duke and the KKK on national television will ultimately alienate young voters. And voters form lifetime party alliances based on the politics during their formative years. If Mr. Trump loses in a landslide, however, this faction of the party will sink back below the Republican Party\u2019s surface, allow the establishment to reassert itself\u2014much as it did when it subsumed the Tea Party in 2014 after the movement suffered losses in the 2012 legislative elections\u2014and build a more inclusive party. But, if Trump wins, this faction will continue pushing its agenda for the foreseeable future. A President Trump would ruin the long-term viability of the Republican Party among young people, turning an entire generation of potential Republicans away from the conservative cause.\u000aA Clinton presidency would give the Republican establishment valuable time to regroup without having to worry about damage control for an erratic President Trump. The Republican National Committee and its backers could instead burnish the national profiles of conservative establishment figures like Paul Ryan and Marco Rubio before the 2018 midterms and 2020 presidential race. In addition to being less divisive and controversial than Trump, Ryan and Rubio are also more popular with the American public. Ryan\u2019s unfavorability rating is 39.0%. Rubio, fresh out of a tough primary season with a barrage of attack ads aimed against him, has an unfavorability rating of 46.0%. Trump\u2019s unfavorability rating is a staggering 61.9%. It is even higher among women, Latinos, black people, and the educated. If this man loses his outsider status and becomes associated with mainstream American conservatism, the Republican Party\u2019s image will be sullied for at least the next decade. Look no further than to what happened to the Democrats after Jimmy Carter, another anti-establishment candidate who inspired an intra-party coalition to block his nomination, was elected President: twelve years of the opposing party controlling the presidency. In contrast, if Republicans abandon Trump in the general election, they could find themselves in a similar situation to the Republican party in 1964, after conservative ideologue Barry Goldwater was defeated in a landslide, with the potential to win the presidency in the next election and the possibility of then holding the presidency for three terms (Republicans weren\u2019t able to keep the White House for three terms because of the Nixon scandal, a one-off event that shouldn\u2019t affect our current calculus).\u000aIndeed, if a Democrat prevails in this presidential election, the Republicans face better odds of winning the White House in 2020 and beyond. Usually, when a president from one party is in power, the opposing party temporarily becomes more popular (The Republicans took advantage of this in the 2010 midterms following President Obama\u2019s election, where Republicans took control of the House and greatly diminished the Democrats\u2019 Senate majority). Because of this upswing in the opposition party\u2019s popularity, the presidency alternates between Republicans and Democrats fairly regularly. The United States has not elected one party to the presidency four times in a row since the time of FDR and Truman. The Democrats\u2019 stranglehold on power in that era was so controversial that a Republican-controlled Congress enacted a constitutional amendment limiting presidents to two terms in office. A one-term Democratic president could boost the Republican Party\u2019s favorability ratings.\u000aA polarizing President Trump, however, would only help the Democrats. As sitting president, Mr. Trump would either secure the 2020 Republican nomination or engage in a bruising primary fight with the eventual nominee (given Trump\u2019s combative personality, he is unlikely to go quietly). Either scenario would severely weaken the GOP candidate and would allow the Democrat\u2014likely to be a gifted young politician like Senator Corey Booker or Senator Martin Heinrich\u2014to win the election in 2020 and enter the 2024 election as an incumbent. To add insult to injury, a Trump administration would not even manage to pass genuinely conservative legislation. From healthcare to Planned Parenthood funding to transgender bathroom access, Mr. Trump has taken liberal stances on a host of policy issues. On the flip-side, a Clinton administration would actually result in more conservative-friendly policies than a Trump administration would, as Secretary Clinton is a foreign-policy hawk, supports free trade, and is unwaveringly pro-Israel.\u000aHillary Clinton is the rational choice for conservative voters this election cycle. Electing a widely loathed demagogue with regressive social policies would irreparably divide the Republican Party. It would also alienate young voters, whose views will be transformed for decades to come by the outcome of this presidential election contest. Among Americans of ages 18-29, Mr. Trump has a net favorability rating\u2014favorables minus unfavorables\u2014of -57. Among Republicans in this age group, this figure is -20, and a quarter of these young Republicans have indicated that they will not vote for Mr. Trump in November if he wins the party\u2019s nomination.\u000aThe future of the Republican Party depends on a Clinton victory in 2016. Whatever you think of her policies, President Clinton is unlikely to destroy American conservatism; Donald Trump invariably will.\u000a_____________________________\u000aImage Source: Wikimedia Commons\u000aShare this:Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)MoreClick to print (Opens in new window)Click to share on Pinterest (Opens in new window)Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)Click to share on Google+ (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Tags: Democrat donald trump election 2016 hillary clinton primary RepublicanCategories: Opinion

p483
aVDuring the height of the racial protests at Claremont McKenna College last November, CMCers of Color issued a list of demands including the resignation of Dean Spellman and the establishment of a permanent \u201csafe space\u201d that would function as a Resource Center for students from marginalized backgrounds.\u000aThe student group wrote an official proposal to the administration, but also created a private Google doc with other miscellaneous items they wanted for their safe space, such as kitchen items and a sound system.\u000aAmong this list is a Shady Person of Color (SPOC) board, which includes a royal court of five members of the CMC community who opposed the group. Brandon Gonzalez, the King SPOC, is the Assistant Dean of Admissions. Gonzalez led the diversity initiative that CMCers of Color felt misrepresented CMC. The Queen SPOC, Hannah Oh (CMC \u201915), was the Editor-in-Chief of the Claremont Independent at the time, and coauthored an editorial critiquing the protestors\u2019 tactics. In a similar vein, Nathan Tsai (CMC \u201917), the \u201cIgnorant SPOC,\u201d wrote a letter that garnered 277 signatures in opposition to the protestors\u2019 demands.

aS'My Political Views Do Not Make Me a Traitor to My Ethnicity'
p487
aVWhen I decided to go to a liberal arts college in California, I did so knowing that my political views were not going to match those of the majority on campus. I didn\u2019t mind this, because the benefits Claremont McKenna College had to offer appeared to outweigh this seemingly minor detail, and I had assumed that my views and I would be treated with at least some respect.\u000aWhen I arrived on campus in the fall, I decided to join the Claremont Independent. Unlike the other newspapers on campus, the Independent is self-funded, beholden to no campus administrator or bureaucrat, and has made reporting the truth its primary responsibility on campus. Despite the many differences in political opinions among the Independent\u2019s staff, every member was accepted, treated with respect, and encouraged to express any contrarian views. Supporting a certain political candidate or having a dissenting opinion was welcomed, not shamed. And naively, I hoped that my college, with a diverse student body holding a wide range of political views, would thrive on intellectual debate and the exchange of ideas just like the Claremont Independent staff.\u000aBut ultimately, my hopes were dashed. Instead of a lively, respectful battle of ideas, I have witnessed the utter mistreatment of those with minority opinions. In one incident, Jose Ruiz (PO \u201916), the Managing Editor of the Independent, was ordered to leave a protest\u2013 which he attended in support of a close friend\u2013simply because of his association with the Independent. A few months later, he was attacked on social media for being a \u201cshady person of color.\u201d\u000aThe term \u201cshady person of color\u201d (SPOC) gets thrown around a lot at the Claremont Colleges. When students of color do not share the prevailing liberal worldview, our peers use this phrase to dismiss our ideas and separate us from the group. Even students whose job is to help students of color feel comfortable on campus participate in this conservative shaming culture. Timothy Valdez (CMC \u201919) who will become a student mentor for the Chicano Latino Student Affairs office (CLSA) this fall, called me a \u201cSPOC\u201d after commenting on a Facebook thread relating to a post in which a CMC student threatened to bully another CMC student out of school. My political views do not make me \u201cshady,\u201d and I will not be cowed by efforts to silence my voice as an independent person of color on this campus.

aVOn Friday, the CMC Forum posted an April 26 letter sent by the former head of the Claremont McKenna College Alumni Association, Carol Hartman (CMC \u201986), to the CMC administration and board of trustees. \u201cThe college setting may be the first time some students have to exhibit empathy, proportionality, responsibility and respect to their peers who might have very differing beliefs, opinions or perspective. It is not the prerogative of a student, who is on campus for 4 years, to change the historical culture and perspective of our college,\u201d Hartman writes. \u201cI do not believe that any majority of the alumni are supporting of the current events and cultural shift at the college.\u201d Hartman goes on to criticize president Chodosh, \u201cA President who leads with his own mission, Social Justice, rather than CMC\u2019s mission. They are not aligned.\u201d\u000aHartman then alludes to an example where her daughter, Kate Hartman, (CMC \u201919) \u201cexperienced racism, delivered by those who say they will not tolerate it.\u201d When the junior Hartman posted a link to Obama\u2019s remarks that college students are too \u201ccoddled\u201d on her Facebook page, Sarah Gissinger (CMC \u201917), who was recently appointed to be a Fellow for Diversity and Inclusion by the Dean of Students office, responded by telling her \u201csince you are white, you have absolutely no business making such a comment.\u201d Ironically, Gissinger later commented, \u201cAs a white person, you will never experience racism.\u201d\u000a\u201cClaremont McKenna College was once a remarkable place,\u201d notes the senior Hartman. \u201cMy experience as a student was that it was a meritocracy. It is not today.\u201d \u000a\u201cMy daughter has applied and been accepted as a transfer to other universities,\u201d she adds. \u201cThe culture of inclusion has created a hostile environment for those who have a different opinion and who are not Persons of Color.\u201d\u000aSome students did not appreciate Hartman\u2019s statements. Liat Kaplan (CMC \u201917)\u2014the Editor-in-Chief of The Golden Antlers, a student publication\u2014responded to the letter with a Facebook post stating, \u201cTbh [to be honest] I would bully that girl out of school if she wasn\u2019t already transferring.\u201d

aS'Editorial: We Tell the Truth When No One Else Will'
p495
aVA recent editorial in The Student Life (TSL) criticized a Claremont Independent article because they thought it opted \u201cfor sensationalism over accuracy and impartiality.\u201d Our article\u2019s title pretty much summed up the story: \u201cBlack Women Protest Campus Party Because Non-Black Women Are Invited.\u201d TSL notes that the event \u201cattracted controversy due to confusion over whether the even [sic] was open to all women of color or only black women.\u201d In other words, there was no inaccuracy or bias in the Independent\u2019s version of the story. And yet, TSL claims our article \u201cdemonstrates no effort to understand the underlying issues behind the controversy or the opinions of the community members affected.\u201d The reality is that we build our news stories from quotes, and allow our sources to tell the story as accurately and impartially as possible rather than trying to provide our own commentary or insight. Simply put, our style of reporting lets the facts speak for themselves. Unfortunately for our radically liberal peers, the facts consistently reveal some serious problems on our campuses.\u000aAnyone who has followed the Independent this year knows that we go to school at one of the most racist and bigoted places in America\u2014but not in the way progressives would like you to think. On multiple occasions, white students (and recently, even non-black students of color) have been excluded from on-campus events solely based on their race. Conservative students of color are bullied because progressive groupthink leads minority students to view any political dissidents as traitors or sellouts to their race. What\u2019s more, this bullying is widely viewed as acceptable by the same progressives who think that any viewpoints aside from their own are offensive. All the lessons on racial equality and acceptance that progressive students supposedly abide by are thrown out the window when dealing with \u201cshady people of color,\u201d a fancy name for nonwhite students who hold different opinions than they do. Pitzer College\u2019s recently appointed Communications Secretary called for a ban on the Claremont Independent and asked, \u201cWhy not ban Steven Glick from even writing all together [sic],\u201d whatever that\u2019s supposed to mean. It\u2019s no surprise that students act in this manner, since administrators openly endorse this sort of behavior. Yet, if you listen to the rhetoric coming from most students at the 5Cs, you\u2019d have the story backwards and believe that white conservative students are the ones perpetuating racism against students of color on campus.\u000aThe reason our stories are so much more successful than those of any other 5C publication is that we are the only paper that actually reports on what life is like in Claremont. Rather than pushing some speculative narrative about how upper-middle class, white, cisgender STEM majors are trying to oppress or silence their fellow students, we report on direct actions taken by student government officials, professors, and administrators to punish those who do not agree with them. We report on issues that the TSL staff doesn\u2019t consider newsworthy, and most of the time they are the ones who feel compelled to respond to us.\u000aMany of our detractors complain about our use of social media and emails to the student body to obtain information, but the information presented in those outlets is exactly what makes our stories so accurate. People are more honest when they don\u2019t think anyone is listening, and the message someone sends to a large audience (such as all students at Pitzer College) always provides a better picture of the ideas they wish to project than a quote given to a single writer representing the Independent.\u000aThe Independent serves many purposes on our campuses: we provide a place for students to express right-leaning or alternative opinions, we inspire dialogue regarding controversial events, and we keep students informed about all of the events TSL is too politically correct to write about. But perhaps most importantly, we let the rest of the world know what is happening in Claremont. National media outlets routinely pick up our articles because of the fact that we share the most interesting stories. Every article we write provides clear evidence exposing our peers for what they are: censorious, bigoted, oversensitive bullies. And the country is taking notice.\u000a \u000aSteven Glick, Editor-in-Chief\u000aTaylor Schmitt, Publisher\u000aJose Ruiz, Managing Editor\u000aShare this:Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)MoreClick to print (Opens in new window)Click to share on Pinterest (Opens in new window)Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)Click to share on Google+ (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Tags: bigot Claremont Independent editorial board jose ruiz Protest racism racist steven glick Taylor Schmitt The Student LifeCategories: Editorial

p499
aVOver the summer of 2015, two Scripps College students spent approximately 500 hours creating the \u201cUnofficial Scripps Survival Guide.\u201d The 217-page guide, intended to help new students acclimate to the college, features lengthy discussions of topics ranging from food and money management to gender identity, race, and privilege.\u000aThe authors state that the term \u201cPreferred Gender Pronoun\u201d (PGP) should be replaced with \u201cGender Pronoun\u201d to avoid offending students whose gender identity differs from their biological sex. \u201cWhile it may seem new and positive, PGP is actually not a good thing,\u201d they write. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing wrong with Gender Pronouns! However once we say \u2018preferred\u2019 we\u2019re invalidating the entire idea. How people identify is how they identify; it is not a \u2018preference.\u2019\u201d Another section dedicated to being a \u201cTrans* Ally\u201d prompts new Scripps students to ask for each of their peers\u2019 gender pronouns in order to avoid unwittingly enforcing the gender binary when they interact with others. The guide also sets forth what is required to become an authentic \u201cally\u201d to marginalized groups: \u201cEnacting a life of accountability and ownership over your own domination and privileges is the only way you can exhibit allyship.\u201d\u000aThe Scripps Survival Guide defines \u201cWhite Privilege\u201d as \u201cthe set of unearned benefits white people gain as a result of systematic racism and discrimination\u201d that \u201cbenefits even those white people who are disadvantaged by other forms of institutionalized oppression like ableism, classism, sexism, homophobia, and transphobia.\u201d The authors add that \u201casking people of color to educate us about racism,\u201d \u201casking people of color to absolve us of our guilt,\u201d and \u201cidentifying the ways that we are engaging in the perpetuation of white supremacy\u201d are all things that \u201cwe need to stop doing right now.\u201d In a section titled \u201cDear white students,\u201d the authors explain that \u201c[r]everse racism cannot exist because white people maintain power over people of color\u201d and \u201cbecause there are no institutions that were founded with the intention of discriminating against white people on the basis of their skin [color].\u201d\u000aSince the guide\u2019s publication, several student movements across the 5Cs, including a \u201cHurting and Healing\u201d event held by The 5C Students of Color Alliance, have advocated for racially segregated spaces (called \u201cSafe Spaces\u201d) which are off-limits to white students. The Motley, a student run café on Scripps\u2019 campus, has already held events exclusively for people of color. The guide justifies this segregation by speaking to the \u201cpolitical\u201d and \u201charm[ful]\u201d nature of the \u201cspace\u201d for people of color, as well as by arguing that creating segregated spaces is simply \u201cthe least we can do\u201d for non-white students. Throughout the sections regarding racism, the authors of the guide agree that \u201ca general distaste or hatred of white people\u201d is a legitimate response to \u201coppression.\u201d\u000aSections of the Survival Guide addressing \u201cMindful Language\u201d and \u201cInclusive Language\u201d tell students to watch what they say inside the classroom, identifying \u201ccapitalism and consumerism\u201d as concepts which \u201ccan lead to [the] dangerous promotion of certain ideals and widespread circulation of stigmatizing information.\u201d The guide also castigates \u201cthose who oppose trigger warnings,\u201d accusing these people of being uncaring and \u201cpotentially sexist, ableist, homophobic, racist, classist, etc.\u201d\u000aThe survival guide also roundly condemns ableist language, denouncing the use of words like \u201cinsane\u201d and \u201cstupid\u201d as \u201cusing disability as a metaphor to describe something negative\u201d and \u201creinforcing [the idea] that mentally ill people shouldn\u2019t be listened to, believed, or valued.\u201d Students also are urged to use the term \u201cdifferently abled\u201d rather than \u201cdisabled\u201d when referring to those with physical disabilities because \u201cdifferently abled\u201d represents the idea that \u201cdisabled people are just as valid as everyone else\u201d and that \u201cbeing disabled in a [sic] ableist world means lack of power and access.\u201d The authors conclude the section by urging students to replace words such as \u201ccrazy,\u201d \u201cdumb,\u201d and \u201cstupid\u201d with words like \u201cunruly,\u201d \u201cmoody,\u201d and \u201cdismantled.\u201d The authors also advise against describing young people as \u201ckids\u201d or \u201cteens,\u201d observing that such terms are \u201cpatronizing\u201d because of how they \u201cbelittle and demean young people\u2019s power\u201d and play into the assumption that \u201cteens are incapable of certain leadership roles or don\u2019t have the mental capacity/self control/understanding to articulate or make good decisions.\u201d\u000aThough the Survival Guide is unofficial, administrators at Scripps College have expressed support for it. \u201cThis student-conceived and student-authored publication is an excellent example of how serious Scripps students are about supporting the newest members of the Scripps community,\u201d stated Charlotte Johnson, Scripps\u2019 Vice President for Student Affairs and Dean of Students, who recently described the phrase \u201c#Trump2016\u201d as \u201cracism\u201d and \u201cintimidation.\u201d\u000aEdit: An earlier version of this story misquoted the survival guide\u2019s suggestions for addressing white privilege.\u000a_________________________\u000aImage: Scripps College\u000aShare this:Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)MoreClick to print (Opens in new window)Click to share on Pinterest (Opens in new window)Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)Click to share on Google+ (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Tags: Gender Pronouns Political Correctness Safe Spaces Trigger Warnings White PrivilegeCategories: Campus News

aS'Why I Haven\xe2\x80\x99t Enjoyed Claremont'
p503
aVWhen I came to Claremont, I hoped to find a loving community and an extended family. Unfortunately, what I found instead is an environment in which professing a commitment to social activism is often more important to my fellow students than actually connecting with the people around them. Many of my progressive classmates concern themselves with berating their peers for their ostensible insensitivity or privilege, rather than with expressing sensitivity to each other.\u000aI have a message for these students: Expecting others to accept your conception of morality\u2014one in which tolerance and acceptance are supposedly paramount\u2014while treating dissenters with disdain is hypocrisy at its finest. You are trying to show people how to better society, which is admirable, but you have forgotten that a better society must start with ourselves. Society is not some vague entity \u2013 it is all around us in our dorms, in our classes, and in our libraries. If we are to demand that others embrace certain ideals, we are obligated to take on these same ideals ourselves and live them out as fully as possible.\u000aWhen we willfully ignore this obligation, however, our community suffers. Deep and lasting relationships are no longer possible; instead, our relationships depend upon whether or not we agree with each other ideologically. When activism becomes more important than establishing sincere, genuine connections with people from different ideological backgrounds, no reasons remain for listening to those who cannot help our political goals. We thus become indignant of even respectful dissent, blinded by a sense of moral superiority that deems any disagreement a moral violation. In this way, we dehumanize each other based on ideology and create a highly judgmental culture that absolves us from needing to treat each other with respect and or consider alternative perspectives.\u000aThis last point is what most upsets me about the Claremont community. Students encourage each other to believe that highlighting the immorality of others is of far greater importance than actually practicing the values which they claim a person must support, accept, and live by in order to be morally good.  How can we improve ourselves if we see only good in ourselves and our opinions and only evil in those who deviate from our worldview? How can we become better people if we rarely place ourselves in a position to contemplate our wrongs? The fact is that no one is perfect, consistent, or correct all of the time, and rather than becoming indignant and aggressive when faced with dissent, students should do better for the community and for themselves by showing each other sincere kindness and understanding.\u000aActivism should not strangle our relationships or limit the compassion we show to others.  If it does, the activism which truly matters\u2014the radical task of loving and accepting one another in spite of our differences\u2014will be left behind, and we will have lost sight of what\u2019s truly important.\u000aShare this:Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)MoreClick to print (Opens in new window)Click to share on Pinterest (Opens in new window)Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)Click to share on Google+ (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Tags: activism claremont conservative diversity Protest Scripps shoshanaCategories: Opinion

aS'To Burn in the Melting Pot: How Can We As Students of Color Better Address Diversity?'
p507
aV\u201cI\u2019m in awe of the diverse backgrounds, talents and academic abilities of the new members of the Class of 2020,\u201d Pomona College\u2019s Dean of Admissions proudly stated in an announcement introducing the admitted class of 2020. \u201cAnd I look forward to welcoming them to the Pomona community.\u201d\u000aStudents and faculty alike are thrilled about Pomona\u2019s admission of the most racially diverse class to date, and understandably so. Racial diversity is certainly something that should be taken into consideration when celebrating a year\u2019s admits and in looking at the progress we as people of color have made in academia. However, race is not the be-all end-all for defining diversity on campus, and nor should it be the sole cause for rejoicing; it is ultimately the diversity of thought that is praiseworthy in building an interconnected, catenated community. Being eager to learn about others\u2019 experiences, I will not feel excited about Pomona\u2019s \u201cdiversity\u201d until the ideologies, political and ethical contrasts, and upbringings of students are as dissimilar, yet still communicable. As a person of color myself, I feel more entitled to confront the number of issues I see with how we as students of color talk about race\u2014not how White people should act\u2014and because I evidently don\u2019t identify as White, I am more concerned about what we can do to start the dialogues about race. The diversity of Pomona\u2019s student body as it stands now is only skin deep, and to make these differences more than a pat-ourselves-on-the-back statistic, we as students regardless of race have to undertake a shift in how we address identity.\u000aThe dynamic diversity of thought begins where the now hollow definition of \u201cdiversity\u201d ends: once the students are admitted and become members of the community. Among those celebrating this historic moment are the current Pomona students of color who push for \u201csafe space\u201d communities built to avoid confrontation with those of dissenting viewpoints\u2014including those within their own demographic(s). Speaking from experience, this alienates people of color with different experiences who may come to a school as diverse as Pomona to seek out dialogue among people with similar identities, yet varied points of view. Defenders of the safe-space phenomenon often argue that it is needed as a coping mechanism as a form of self-preservation, but the reality is that any method resulting in removing oneself from opportunities to reach out to other people will, whatever one calls it, make both parties less likely to connect.\u000aCreating a vibrant conversation between different identities and experiences is the only way to take the fullest advantage of diversity on campus. But so far, this conversation has not seemed possible. The endless \u201cdiscussions\u201d on campus engender a warped sort of echo-chamber validation that further incentivizes students to avoid conversations with those who hold conflicting views or opinions. Student-led discussions, such as the sustained dialogue on silencing and \u201ctone policing\u201d held at Scripps last semester, have amounted to nothing more than a way for students to express aggressive hostility to opposing views while silencing any kind of rebuttal or challenge to their beliefs. To these students, as Sophie Mann so aptly put it, feelings assume the role of facts, and both the vilified and the vilifying parties go their separate ways bereft of intellectual growth.\u000aWhile I have witnessed both White and non-White students distancing themselves from conversations regarding race, White students do not expect the same sort of understanding of, and empathy towards, their identity that many students of color do. This sentiment makes sense, as White students\u2019 racial identities are generally not challenged nor made vulnerable by the presence of their counterparts, as it is such the other way around; this is to say that White people do not need the kind of consolation many students of color have come to necessitate. Their desire for commiseration is unmet because they are seeking a number of paradoxical and mutually incompatible forms of treatment from White students. In looking to White students for validation and affirmation of their racial identity, they simultaneously believe White students are unable to comprehend the very concept of racial identity. They then embrace a self-victimizing mentality which garners only pity, not respect, from White students. Though much of their unease and uncomfortability is legitimate and warranted, the fellow-feeling they receive from White students, ironically in the form of pity or subtle patronization, is not as respectful or as congenial as they would like.\u000aWhat confuses me the most is how although students of color want White students to look through their eyes, they expect that White students come into conversations about racial identity already looking through the eyes of a person of color, or at the very least with an adequate amount of knowledge about race. After conjecturing that many White students do not have the faculty or the background to discuss race, they insist on White people \u201ceducating themselves\u201d because they have Google and, as has been explained to me on countless occasions, they have \u201cthe necessary researching skills, given that they made it to such a prestigious college.\u201d But how can students of color seriously expect White people to even care about their issues when they push and pull White people so much? White people are not under any actual obligation, and have no need to, become more racially sensitive and aware. When students of color will not take the time to explain what race means to them, they then  give up the right to complain about how ignorant they believe White people to be, given that their silence is contributing to it. These antinomies result from both insecurities of the racial identities of these students of color, along with a feeling that if somebody\u2014against whom these students are biased\u2014legitimizes a belief system that may prove conflicting with their own, then their beliefs are somehow of more merit and thusly more authoritative accounts of the \u201cperson of color experience.\u201d The problem is that although a few White students may genuinely not want to discuss race, or even spend time with people of color, the rest are quite receptive and open to hearing about people of color\u2019s racial experiences, but are made less so by the exasperating struggle to even know where to begin learning.\u000aBut this is not only the fault of the students; the administration is also involved in further lowering the impetus of White students heeding racial issues with serious consideration. Given the recent push on campus for college-approved, racially-segregated safe spaces, the Claremont Colleges have become complicit in furthering the self-congratulatory, mutual admiration society that limits the discourse they claim to want to promote by having students of so many unique, yet dissimilar identities. What\u2019s worse, the colleges play no role in preventing what comes from these delineations: entitled, one-sided demurring where even people of color are humiliated and silenced when their views do not fall in line with the progressive narrative. If admitting such a racially manifold group of students results in their self-removal and lack of ideation from exposure to other identities and experiences, does racial diversity warrant celebration at all?\u000aIn their efforts to diversify the student body, Pomona recently adopted a strategic plan created by the President\u2019s Advisory Committee on Diversity entitled \u201cLighting the Path to 2025: A Vision for Diversity.\u201d In this document, the word \u201cdiversity\u201d is defined as \u201cthe multiple, intersecting dimensions of difference that help distinguish one individual or group from another.\u201d This plan does include a section on seeking to \u201cfoster a climate that welcomes dissenting views,\u201d though the only strategy proposed to do so is to \u201cpromote social spaces of interaction between faculty, staff, and students.\u201d But in practice, these spaces\u2014such as the sustained dialogues\u2014are not settings where discourse is encouraged. Rather, they provide a bully pulpit for those students who have no interest in considering or internalizing others\u2019 opinions, and discourage students with different views from contributing to the discourse on campus. As far as I have seen, it is the students of color who are reluctant to adapt to a climate of dissenting views. Within the echo chambers of these race-specific communities, an aversion to the consideration of opposing viewpoints  is glorified.\u000aMuch of this vision only seeks to integrate a greater number of people of color into Pomona without addressing the already present and crippling fissures disuniting the student body: students of color\u2019s feelings of disregard towards their identities, White students\u2019 feelings of being villainized despite them making their best efforts to engage in a dialogue with students of color, and neither party having a successful means of communication. Students of non-minority demographics are expected to embrace and embody these other identities while remaining silent about their own, even though they themselves contribute to the diversity of Pomona. They are asked to internalize the experiences and opinions of marginalized students, yet there is no reciprocation of this sentiment on behalf of \u201cnon-marginalized\u201d students. If even as diversity stands now there is this much dissonance, how can we expect the community to develop with even more variation in the student body?\u000aWhile the administration of Pomona itself can create as many resources, opportunities, and conversations from the top down as it wants, it is up to the students to challenge and better themselves and their perspectives. Before we begin to focus on admitting more diverse students, we need to establish a culture of discourse so that those already here can freely express their beliefs in a dialogical manner. What we need to do as a community is to understand that each and every student admitted to Pomona has their own unique and equally-valuable narrative regardless of race. With these various upbringings, creating conversations that may be uncomfortable or objectionable to some\u2014yet pivotal for expressing the identity of others\u2014may help bridge the gap because there will be less hesitation to have challenging discussions. Much of the diversity that we as a community seek will come from our exposure to the diversity of thought, not the diversity of superficial qualities.\u000a_______________________\u000aImage Source: Flickr\u000aShare this:Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)MoreClick to print (Opens in new window)Click to share on Pinterest (Opens in new window)Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)Click to share on Google+ (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Tags: claremont diversity intellectual Pomona quinn clarkeCategories: Opinion

aS'Black Women Protest Campus Party Because Non-Black Women Are Invited'
p511
aVThis Friday, Black Lives At Mudd (BLAM) is hosting an event for \u201cBlack Woman & Non-Gender Conforming People\u201d in order to have \u201ca celebration of what black women have done for this community through a presentation involving black men in the 5\u2019cs [sic].\u201d\u000a\u201cWe want to build community and have a safe fun space to kick back and chill,\u201d BLAM states on the event\u2019s Facebook page. \u201cTransportation, food, and tickets will be provided for Black Woman and Non-Gender Conforming people. Allies will be handled according to resources.\u201d\u000aThe event comes in response to Friday\u2019s annual \u201cDinner for the Sistahs\u201d event hosted by Building Leaders On Campus (BLOC), an all-male organization for \u201cself-identified marginalized\u201d students with a largely black membership. Dinner for the Sistahs is designed to be \u201can opportunity for the men of BLOC and the WOC [women of color] of the 7Cs to interact and get to know one another.\u201d This year, \u201cAny WOC is able to attend\u201d Dinner for the Sistahs, according to the event\u2019s Facebook page. In previous years, the event \u201cwas catered to Black WOC\u201d at the Claremont Colleges.\u000aMany black female students did not approve of this change. \u201cThere have been several complaints by Black womyn about the BLOC event that is happening on Friday and from what I have seen, it seems to me that the men of BLAM wanted to explicitly make sure that the womyn who felt oppressed and not welcomed by the structure and advertisement of \u2018Dinner for the Sistahs\u2019 felt loved and wanted to create an actual safe space for Black womyn\u2014with the input of Black womyn,\u201d stated Ashley Land (PO \u201916). \u201cIn my honest opinion, I feel like the dinner is being half-assed, it is last minute, it is devaluing black womyn by not even letting them have two hours with them as the focus (when the event was originally created for Black womyn\u2026like how you gonna make the event called Dinner for the Sistahs when the word \u2018sistah\u2019 is historically seeded with Black womyn in mind???).\u201d\u000aLand adds, \u201cI think this Thursday\u2019s BLOC meeting needs to revolve around what work y\u2019all can put in to make a more this campus a more inclusive community. You should question why the Black womyn are critiquing BLOC the way they are and what can we do to be better in the future. This is work y\u2019all need to do on y\u2019all on [sics throughout].\u201d\u000a\u201cThis is sh*tty and it ignores the fact that a sh*t ton of woc are anti-black on these campuses. Thanks for being complicit in the violence by opening the space. Gross,\u201d stated Erin Houston-Burroughs (SC \u201917).\u000aBLOC responded to these criticisms by emphasizing that black women were still the focus of the event. \u201cAfter considering feedback from all parties, we want to make it clear that this dinner is centered first and foremost around Black Womyn. The purpose of this dinner is to create a safe space for all participants in which they can enjoy themselves and feel unthreatened in a warm, community-based environment. We had no intentions of compromising this safe space nor did we have any inclination that opening up this event to all WOC would have this adverse effect.\u201d\u000aBLOC ultimately canceled Dinner for the Sistahs, and will instead host a forum to discuss the controversy.\u000a___________________\u000aImage: Facebook\u000aShare this:Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)MoreClick to print (Opens in new window)Click to share on Pinterest (Opens in new window)Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)Click to share on Google+ (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Tags: Inclusivity pomona college Race WomynCategories: Campus News

aS'CLSA Response \xe2\x80\x9cTrumps\xe2\x80\x9d Claremont Administration and Students'
p515
aVThe Chicano Latino Student Affairs Office (CLSA) released their monthly newspaper CHISPAS in April with a statement from the Associate Dean of Students, Tony Jimenez, in support of political diversity within Chican@ / Latin@ student groups at the Claremont Colleges.\u000a\u201cWith international upheaval, the 2016 presidential election and the issues at the colleges, it is important that we take care of each other.\u201d Dean Jimenez states. \u201cWe are a community with a diversity of political beliefs and viewpoints. As such, it is very important that we have mutual respect for each other, even when we disagree.\u201d He adds, \u201cWhat makes us strong is not only our diversity of nations, but our diverse viewpoints. College is a time to engage in thoughtful discourse. Please be mindful and respectful of others. At times we may disagree on our ideas, but we can still have respect for our fellow members of the Claremont community.\u201d\u000aThis statement comes in stark contrast to administrators\u2019 responses to recent political and criminal acts on campus, in which the administrations of both Scripps and Pitzer Colleges condemned the word \u201cTrump\u201d as racism. Scripps\u2019 Dean Charlotte Johnson responded by saying that \u201cnegative reaction registered by many members of the community is understandable and far from extreme. As all who have experienced can confirm, racist acts and intimidation are not always overt,\u201d in reference to the phrase \u201c#trump2016\u201d written on a Mexican-American student\u2019s whiteboard. Dean Johnson also mentioned her support of first amendment rights and freedom of expression on campus, but highlights that unique circumstances allow speech to be considered hateful or intimidating to students of certain identities. Pitzer\u2019s Dean of Students, Moya Carter, went so far as to denounce the \u201cfoolish, embarrassing, hate filled, Islamophobic, fact devoid behavior being represented by some of the [presidential] candidates\u201d just before reminding students to accept diversity of political opinions on campus.\u000aStudents at Pitzer and Scripps, however, thought that the statements and actions from administration did not go far enough. Pitzer students wanted the administration to condemn the vandalism as a hate crime and racial intimidation. Scripps College Student President Minjoo Kim openly denounced the Donald Trump messages, immediately assuming that this was an act of racism, harassment, violence, and intimidation of Chican@ / Latin@ students on college campuses. Based on the information from both incidents, we cannot be sure whether or not these messages were written to harass and intimidate students of color. Regardless, it is absurd to claim that messages written on whiteboards and walls are violent or dangerous. This is especially absurd at liberal arts colleges, where \u201cdangerous\u201d ideas are supposed to be discussed in an honest and respectful manner. Vandalizing school property at Pitzer and writing \u201ctrump2016\u201d on whiteboards at Scripps is childish and immature, but student responses toward these acts are equally troublesome.\u000aStudents like these who consistently advocate for increased racial diversity and support on college campus also need to accept the consequences of diversity in all its aspects. Back in March, my peers created a Facebook page to attack me based on my race and my right-leaning political beliefs after I wrote an article about Callisto, a sexual assault reporting app that has the potential to increase sexual assault reporting rates on college campuses. Other students at the Claremont Colleges simply cannot accept the fact that some Latino students do not follow the typical progressive narrative on campus. With conservative and libertarian college students making up a very small minority of the student population, this shortage is much more noticeable for students of color at the Claremont Colleges who, more often than not, only know a handful of students who they can relate to on both a political and racial or cultural level.\u000aCLSA recognizes that Chican@ / Latin@ students come from different countries, have different nationalities, and come from a wide variety of socioeconomic, religious, and political backgrounds. Many of CLSA\u2019s cultural and student programming events recognize and respect the diversity within the Chican@ / Latin@ community. CLSA supported all students participating in student protests, discussions, and other activities relating to the lack of institutional support for marginalized students in their December newsletter. The office does a good job of talking to and accommodating students from all these different backgrounds. I\u2019ve felt nothing but compassion, understanding, and honesty from the deans and staff that work at CLSA these past four years.\u000aAccepting more and more diverse student bodies doesn\u2019t necessarily mean more students of color. It also means more conservative students, more students from different income backgrounds, and more students from increasingly different cultural, international, and political backgrounds. We are put in an environment where ideas are supposed to clash, contradict, and compile with each other so that we are all better students by the time we graduate. Sure, I would love to see more libertarian, conservative, low-income, first generation Mexican-American student-athletes at the Claremont Colleges, but my personal growth and development would not progress if I was surrounded by students who are just like me all the time. Increased diversity on our college campuses will create more of these clashing ideological conflicts, but we have to accept and learn from those experiences if we want to become better students and a truly inclusive campus community.\u000aShare this:Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)MoreClick to print (Opens in new window)Click to share on Pinterest (Opens in new window)Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)Click to share on Google+ (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Tags: chicana chicano claremont clsa jose ruiz latina latino PomonaCategories: Opinion

aS'Debunking the Wage Gap Myth'
p519
aVOn April 12th, feminist organizations across the United States acknowledged Equal Pay Day, a date which symbolizes just how far into the new calendar year a woman must work in order to earn what a man did in the previous year. The White House reports that a typical full-time working woman in the U.S. in 2014 made only 79 cents for every dollar that a full-time working man earned. Based on this data and \u201cdecades of research,\u201d the White House has concluded that women face a \u201creal and persistent problem\u201d of pay discrimination across the country. But upon closer examination, the gender wage gap reveals itself to be based far more in fiction than in fact.\u000aFirst, the oft-cited 79-cent figure offers a woefully incomplete picture of the actual disparity or lack thereof between the wages of men and women. The Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) calculates the popular figure by taking the median annual earnings of all full-time male and female workers and dividing them into one another. Though this approach gives us a gross approximation of how much more men earn than women on average, it fails\u2014as the BLS freely admits\u2014to \u201ccontrol for many factors that can be significant in explaining earnings differences.\u201d\u000aOne of these factors is hours worked. Though the Bureau of Labor Statistics only includes full-time workers\u2014those employees who work 35 or more hours a week\u2014it does not distinguish between those who work beyond this cutoff. This difference turns out to be significant, as men tend to work longer hours. According to the Department of Labor, 25 percent of full-time male workers spent 41 or more hours on the job, while only 14 percent of female full-time workers did the same. And when only men and women who work more than 40 hours a week are compared, the wage gap shrinks by more than half to only ten cents.\u000aDifferences in occupation and experience also explain the wage differential between men and women. In 2013, PayScale\u2014an online compensation information company\u2014conducted a survey of men and women across over 120 different occupational categories. The survey grouped the salaries of the respondents by occupation and level of experience and then found the median pay for each gender within each category, thereby isolating men and women with similar jobs and experience and comparing them side-by-side. According to The Atlantic, PayScale\u2019s study showed that the wage gap \u201cnearly evaporates\u201d when workers of similar experience and occupation are compared. As PayScale\u2019s chief economist Katie Bardaro noted, \u201cthe gender wage gap disappears for most positions\u201d when education and management responsibilities  are considered.\u000aPayScale\u2019s survey also uncovered a late-career wage gap between women and men. Though both sexes command similar wages at the start of their careers, female wages tend to fall behind those of men over time. But this differential is less evidentiary of pay discrimination against women than it is a result of men and women fulfilling different career preferences and making different life choices. For example, an international study conducted in 2013 by the career networking site LinkedIn found that nearly two-thirds of professional women view \u201cfinding the right balance between work and personal life\u201d as their definition of success in the workplace, while less than half prioritize \u201cearning a high salary.\u201d And as Carrie Lukas from the Independent Women\u2019s Forum discussed in Forbes Magazine, women value jobs which offer \u201cregular hours, more comfortable conditions, little travel, and greater personal fulfillment,\u201d and sacrifice a higher salary in order to obtain these attractive occupational benefits.\u000aBut according to Claudia Goldin, an economics professor at Harvard University, men feel differently, preferring \u201cincome growth\u201d to \u201ctemporal flexibility\u201d in the workplace. This is part of the reason why the ten most dangerous occupations in the United States\u2014all jobs which pay well relative to the education level they require but involve an extraordinary risk of bodily harm or death\u2014are all male-dominated, with all but one of these jobs having more than a 94 percent male workforce. As Mark Perry from the American Enterprise Institute cheekily notes, males are so heavily represented in the most dangerous occupations that the next \u201cEqual Occupational Fatality Day\u201d\u2014the day on which the number of work-related deaths of women will match the number which men experienced last calendar year\u2014will be over thirteen years from now.\u000aThe different preferences of males and females manifest themselves in other ways too. In college, women tend to select majors which lead to lower-paying careers, while men do the opposite. According to research by Georgetown University economist Anthony Carnevale, only one of the ten lowest-paying majors\u2014\u201ctheology and religious vocations\u201d\u2014is chosen more often by men, while \u201cpharmacy sciences and administration\u201d is the only one of the top ten highest-paying degrees which is majority female. But as I mentioned before, women tend to value having a meaningful job more than earning a high income, which explains their dominance of social work professions, like psychology and education, which generally are less lucrative than other professions.\u000aThe most significant difference in preferences between men and women, however, has to do with children. Because women opt to stay home and raise their children more often than men do, the median wage of women late in their careers does not keep pace with that of men, who usually decide to become or remain the principal breadwinners of their household. But when a man voluntarily exits the workforce for several years to raise his child, he cannot reasonably expect when he returns to command a wage equal to or higher than that of a woman who stayed at her job during the man\u2019s absence and continued to acquire experience. The same holds true for the working woman who decides to leave her job in favor of rearing her child. Leaving the workforce to have and raise a child is a choice, a choice which carries foreseeable economic consequences and a nondiscriminatory impact.\u000aHaving accounted for the various variables which contribute to the wage gap\u2014hours worked, occupation and experience, and different preferences\u2014we now turn to the critical final argument made by progressives with respect to the gender wage gap. By this line of reasoning, the earnings differential between women and men is reflective of a \u201creal and persistent problem\u201d of pay discrimination in the United States which, as the White House puts it, \u201ccontinues to shortchange American women and their families.\u201d Even if economics can explain some or even most of the wage gap by \u201cfactoring in the kind of work people do\u201d or \u201cqualifications such as education and experience,\u201d discrimination is the cause of whatever pay disparity remains. Therefore, the argument concludes, pay inequity must be addressed through even more sweeping government mandates and wage controls.\u000aSingle, childless women and men are the ideal sample with which to evaluate this claim. If systematic pay discrimination actually exists, women who have not yet raised a child or made any particularly dramatic life choices which can alter their earnings should have lower wages than men. But according to Time Magazine, an analysis of 2,000 communities in cities across the United States revealed that the median full-time salaries of unmarried, childless women \u201care an average of eight percent higher\u201d than those of similarly situated men. In Atlanta and Memphis, this wage gap increases to a whopping 20 percent. In New York City, it is 17 percent. Coupling these figures with PayScale\u2019s finding that \u201cthe gender wage gap disappears\u201d when the education and responsibilities of young workers are considered, the claim that pay discrimination against women is a persistent problem which requires dramatic federal remedies simply does not hold water.\u000aEqual Pay Day embodies a disingenuous and misleading narrative about the gender wage gap in the United States. The oft-cited 21-cent wage gap figure does not account for a multitude of factors such as occupation, experience, career preferences, and major life choices which, when combined, virtually eliminate the wage differential between men and women. And with no substantive evidence of systematic pay discrimination against women in sight, it seems that January 1st would make for a much better date for Equal Pay Day.\u000a______________________\u000aImage Source: Flickr\u000a \u000aShare this:Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)MoreClick to print (Opens in new window)Click to share on Pinterest (Opens in new window)Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)Click to share on Google+ (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Tags: Equal Pay Feminism Wage GapCategories: Opinion

aS'Student Senator: Picture of Gun is a Threat to \xe2\x80\x9cBlack Mental and Emotional Health\xe2\x80\x9d'
p523
aVEarly Monday morning, Gregory Ochiagha (PZ \u201918), a Student Senator at Pitzer College, sent out an email to the student body criticizing a mural recently painted on campus. The mural, painted by Selena Spier (PZ \u201919), depicts a handgun with flowers coming out of the end and was approved by the Pitzer College aesthetics committee.\u000a\u201cIt\u2019s truly in bad taste to have a large depiction of a gun in a dorm space\u2014especially when students of color also reside there,\u201d states Ochiagha. \u201cNow let\u2019s imagine there were countless videos of white teenagers, white teenagers that look like you, or your brother or your sister, get shot to death by police officers. Imagine scrolling down Facebook everyday and seeing a new video of the same thing, over and over again. Really put yourself in that headspace. Then ask yourself whether it\u2019s the brightest idea to have white teenagers, who have a very real fear of getting shot, see a large gun every time they want to get food from the dinning [sic] hall.\u201d\u000aOchiagha continues, \u201cMy Black Mental and Emotional Health Matters. I shouldn\u2019t be reminded every time I leave my dorm room of how easy my life can be taken away, or how many Black lives have been taken away because of police brutality. This is emotionally triggering for very obvious reasons. And if you want to belittle or invalidate by [sic] black experience, I live in Atherton, come thru, let\u2019s have that idiotic conversation.\u201d\u000aJessica Folsom (PZ \u201819) responded by providing additional background on the mural. \u201cJust to preface this, I am not trying to dismiss how you feel or belittle your experience as a student of color,\u201d she states. \u201cThis mural is actually representative of a nonviolence movement to protest the Vietnam War in the 60s. There\u2019s a famous photo of a protester putting flowers in the barrel of a National Guardsman\u2019s rifle and everything.\u201d Folsom continues, \u201cI thought it might be an important distinction to make between what the mural actually represents and perhaps the romanticized aesthetic of a gun which someone (maybe you?) could potentially mistake this for. I hope this helps.\u201d\u000aNot all students felt that Ochiagha\u2019s reaction was warranted. \u201cI actually love the mural and thought it was obvious that it was about the flower power movement/a message of anti-violence,\u201d wrote Jennifer McNamara (PZ \u201819). \u201cIt was approved by the aesthetics committee and the artist has freedom of speech within her design. I\u2019m excited to see it finished.\u201d\u000aAlessandra Elliott (PZ \u201818) added, \u201cI love our radical liberalism. However, I\u2019m not in love with the trend of shutting down voices that don\u2019t align with liberal ideologies.\u201d\u000aSpier plans to modify her mural. \u201cI spoke with Gregory earlier and we agreed on a modification that preserves the integrity of the original piece while avoiding any potentially triggering content\u2014it\u2019s a change I was absolutely happy to make in the interest of creating a safe and inclusive environment for everyone in my community,\u201d Spier told the Claremont Independent. \u201cI have absolutely no right to decide whether or not my artwork is offensive to marginalized communities\u2014nor does anyone else in a position of privilege, racial or otherwise.\u201d\u000a \u000a \u000a___________________\u000aImage: Facebook\u000aShare this:Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)MoreClick to print (Opens in new window)Click to share on Pinterest (Opens in new window)Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)Click to share on Google+ (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Tags: Guns Inclusivity Political Correctness Safe Space TriggeringCategories: Campus News

aVIn an opinion editorial published in this morning\u2019s edition of The Wall Street Journal, Republican presidential candidate Donald J. Trump unleashes a blistering critique of the presidential nomination process, excoriating the party establishment for \u201cdefending a system that for decades has served the interest of political parties at the expense of the people.\u201d The editorial embodies the anti-establishment flavor of Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign as it rails against a \u201crigged delegate-selection process\u201d while pledging to seek future reforms which maximize \u201ctransparency,\u201d \u201crepresentation,\u201d and \u201cvoter participation\u201d in the GOP\u2019s nomination procedures.\u000aMr. Trump\u2019s words come on the heels of a major setback for him in Colorado\u2019s caucuses last weekend, where Senator Ted Cruz swept every delegate and affirmed the superiority of his well-organized national campaign. The massive loss was full of blunders for the Trump campaign, which printed a delegate slate full of errors and misdirected the votes of many Trump supporters at the state convention. But for Mr. Trump, poor preparation had little to do with his loss. On Monday, the New York businessman took to Twitter to air his grievances, calling the Colorado caucus process \u201ctotally unfair\u201d and accusing Ted Cruz of bribing delegates with \u201call sorts of goodies\u201d in order to gain an advantage.1 In Mr. Trump\u2019s estimation, the corrupt election system dominated by party elites\u2014not his own campaign team\u2019s failure to understand and organize for the Colorado caucus process\u2014should bear the blame for his poor showing there.\u000aTo evaluate this claim, I will examine the Colorado caucus process in the context of Mr. Trump\u2019s complaints, focusing upon the history and the political justifications which undergird the changes made to the Colorado process last year.\u000a \u000aThe recent history of the Colorado caucuses\u000aThe establishment wins in 2012\u000aIn 2012, former Republican senator Rick Santorum won the Colorado caucuses, defeating Mitt Romney, the former Massachusetts governor who was the preferred candidate of the so-called \u201cparty establishment,\u201d by nearly six points. Mr. Santorum\u2019s victory came as a surprise, particularly in light of the fact that Mr. Romney had won the state\u2019s caucuses handily back in 2008 with over three-fifths of the vote.\u000aYet when it came time for Colorado\u2019s delegates to cast their ballots in the 2012 Republican National Convention, not a single vote was cast for Mr. Santorum. Instead, because the delegates selected for the national convention were not bound by the vote in the precinct caucuses, Mitt Romney received the support of most of the state\u2019s delegation, while the others simply refused to participate. Many party activists and grassroots conservatives in Colorado felt betrayed by this sleight-of-hand, which they viewed as an effort by the Republican Party establishment to force its candidate of choice onto the voters.\u000aTaking back control in 2016\u000aWith the rise of Jeb Bush in the early moments of the presidential primary process last year, Republican Party grassroots activists in Colorado became deeply concerned. As the National Review recalled early this week, many conservatives were worried about a repeat of 2012, where Colorado\u2019s state delegation was press-ganged into supporting Mitt Romney at the Republican National Convention. At the same time, a binding straw poll\u2014though an improvement over the non-binding presidential preference vote which permitted Mr. Romney to win a delegate majority in spite of losing the state\u2014would favor a well-funded establishment candidate, who could simply spend a few million dollars in the state to buy up advertising and build a traditional ground campaign in lieu of actually investing time and energy to reach out to grassroots conservatives.\u000aFor these reasons, party activists pushed for the abandonment of the precinct straw poll in favor of the direct election of delegates by voters in precinct caucuses, a move which gave Republicans the opportunity to elect grassroots conservatives in their communities as delegates to the county caucuses. These county caucuses would then choose delegates for the congressional-district and state assemblies, at which the final delegates for the national convention would be chosen. Unlike in 2012, all of the delegates selected for the national convention are bound to the presidential candidate for whom they have stated a preference, and each delegate\u2019s preference is known to the caucus assemblies prior to the final vote.\u000aThe net effect of creating this complex system is two-fold. First, the elimination of the precinct straw poll, which enabled Coloradans to cast a vote for the presidential candidate of their preference, in favor of precinct caucus elections of county delegates ensures that passionate grassroots conservatives, rather than representatives of the best-funded campaign organization, would be favored for election as delegates to the county, state, and congressional-district assemblies. Had such a system existed back in 2012, Rick Santorum likely would have won significant majorities among the county convention delegations, which then could have assured him at least a majority of the state\u2019s delegation at the Republican National Convention.\u000aSecond, by binding the delegates to the presidential candidate of their preference at the conclusion of this lengthy process, the state party rules safeguard against efforts by an establishment candidate to woo the state\u2019s delegates and subvert the will of the conservative grassroots activists who participated in the precinct caucuses and organized for the candidate who best represents their views.\u000a \u000aEvaluating Trump\u2019s claims about Colorado\u000a Claim #1: \u201c[T]he people of Colorado were not able to cast their ballots to say which nominee they preferred.\u201d\u000aMr. Trump\u2019s careful wording here is technically correct. Because the presidential preference poll was abandoned, Republican voters in Colorado could not vote for any of the presidential candidates by name.\u000aThat said, the alternative was not, as Mr. Trump seems to imply, the coronation of Mr. Cruz by Republican party elites. Though there was no presidential preference poll, Colorado voters participated in precinct caucuses to directly elect delegates\u2014each of whom expressed a particular candidate preference\u2014to the county assemblies, which in turn chose the makeup of the congressional-district and state conventions which would select the official national convention delegates. Therefore, in practice, the Colorado caucuses did permit voters to cast ballots for the nominee of their preference through the direct election of county delegates.\u000aClaim #2: The delegate selection process in Colorado was \u201crigged\u201d and \u201ctotally unfair.\u201d\u000aComplicated, perhaps. Rigged? Not at all.\u000aThe rules of the GOP Colorado caucuses are readily available online. Though they are complex, they are not difficult to grasp, and the rules clearly state how the process operates. And with respect to fairness, the mechanics of the caucuses were completely aboveboard. The vigorous debate within the state party last August about dealing away with the presidential preference poll occurred in full view of the public and culminated in a unanimous decision from the Colorado Republican Party\u2019s executive committee to change the process to its current form. Mr. Trump had just as much time as all of the other candidates to prepare a campaign strategy that would succeed, and he was more than capable of posting a decent showing there had he made an effort to organize in the state. But no such effort was expended, and Mr. Trump lost.\u000aIs there a better alternative to the current system?\u000aTurning from Donald Trump\u2019s specific criticisms of the Colorado caucuses, I wonder what sort of primary election process he would propose to replace the unrepresentative and opaque system which he claims we have now.\u000aMr. Trump appears to desire a simpler system which rewards candidates by proportion to their support in presidential preference elections. If a candidate has \u201cby far the most delegates and many millions more votes than anyone else,\u201d as the businessman tweeted last Friday, he or she should no longer have to \u201cfight\u201d for the nomination. In response to a debate question on the subject last month, Mr. Trump stated that \u201cwhoever gets the most delegates should win.\u201d\u000aThese comments seem to support the adoption of a national proportional primary system, a similar process to the one which the Democratic Party currently uses. If a candidate wins a certain percent of the vote in a proportional primary, she should receive roughly that same percentage of the delegates from her victory. This sort of system is simple and fair, and I am not opposed to it.\u000aHowever, Mr. Trump\u2019s contention that the person with only a plurality\u2014not a majority\u2014of the delegates should be awarded the nomination anyway sets a dangerous precedent. A fractured nomination contest with multiple contenders could permit a fringe candidate with minority support to become the party\u2019s representative in the general election, a development which would disenfranchise a majority of the party\u2019s members and create a scenario in which one of the fundamental obligations of the political party\u2014to tie its representatives to a distinct philosophical framework\u2014would be left unfulfilled. It is in these situations, where the democratic process is unable to yield a decisive majority consensus, that political party leaders are so important to have. If Mr. Trump is unable to attain a majority of delegates\u2014or, for that matter, a majority of the popular vote\u2014there is no opportunity to turn back the clock and retry the election until he or another candidate can convince a majority of Republican voters that he is the best choice available to them. In the absence of time travel or do-overs, the delegates at the Republican National Convention must have the ultimate say if a candidate fails to demonstrate the evidence of consensus which a majority represents.\u000aFootnotes

aS'28 Scripps Professors Will Protest Madeleine Albright\xe2\x80\x99s Commencement Speech'
p531
aVYesterday\u2019s issue of The Student Life contained an open letter, signed by twenty-eight Scripps faculty members, criticizing the selection of former U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright to deliver the commencement speech at Scripps College this May.\u000a\u201cAs concerned Scripps faculty members, we are outraged at the selection of Madeleine Albright as the 2016 Commencement speaker and will not participate in this year\u2019s graduation ceremony,\u201d the professors write. \u201cOur opposition to her speaking at commencement, however, has to do with her record during her service as U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations and U.S. Secretary of State.\u201d\u000aThe professors condemn Albright for supporting sanctions on Iraq, for removing UN troops from Rwanda (Albright has stated, \u201cMy deepest regret from my years in public service is the failure of the United States and the international community to act sooner to halt these crimes), and for advocating for the U.S. bombing of Yugoslavia.\u000aThe letter adds that, \u201cAs a member of the Clinton administration, Albright was crucial in the crafting of \u2018Plan Colombia,\u2019 which funneled billions of dollars in aid to the country, 80 percent of which took the form of military aid to security forces, during a time when those forces were linked to right-wing paramilitary organizations.\u201d\u000aThe faculty members also oppose having Albright speak at graduation because they don\u2019t feel she\u2019s done enough over the course of her career that is in ideological accordance with the demands Scripps students came up with last semester to encourage \u201cunlearning.\u201d\u000a\u201cThe selection of Albright as the 2016 Commencement speaker runs counter to the spirit of student activism during fall 2015, which resulted in the demand to address institutional racism, among other forms of barred access,\u201d the professors write. \u201cAs a women\u2019s liberal arts college, we should promote the advancement of women and transgender peoples broadly and not simply emulate and celebrate those individuals who participate in U.S. state power and wield its violence. Representing the category of \u2018woman\u2019 in this way evacuates feminism of its anti-racist, anti-paternalistic, and anti-imperialist potential to address those lives that are systematically made vulnerable to sickness and death.\u201d\u000aThe professors conclude their email by demanding they be included in the commencement speaker selection process rather than leaving that decision up to students. \u201cWith respect to the process for commencement speaker selection, it is our understanding that the selection is currently left in the hands of the senior class leadership with no input from faculty or other community members,\u201d the letter states. \u201cBecause the commencement speaker is representative not only of the current senior class but also of the broader Scripps community, the process of selection should be reconsidered to better reflect Scripps values and commitments. In consideration of Scripps values and of our commitments to students and the institution, we will not be walking in graduation this year in protest of Albright\u2019s presence.\u201d\u000aShare this:Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)MoreClick to print (Opens in new window)Click to share on Pinterest (Opens in new window)Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)Click to share on Google+ (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Tags: albright claremont College commencement professors Protest Scripps steven glickCategories: Campus News

aS'Hispanic Pitzer Student Criticized for Denying the Word \xe2\x80\x98Trump\xe2\x80\x99 is Hate Speech'
p535
aVOver the weekend, several places on Pitzer College\u2019s campus were spray painted with pro-Trump messages. Last Sunday, Brian Carlisle\u2014the Vice President for Student Affairs at Pitzer College\u2014responded to the vandalism and set off a firestorm of student responses.\u000aCarlisle condemned the \u201chate filled message\u201d\u2014referring to the phrase \u201cMake America,\u201d presumably the first half of Republican frontrunner Donald Trump\u2019s campaign slogan\u2014that was written over an on-campus mural. Carlisle also stated, \u201charassment and intimidation will never be accepted at Pitzer\u201d and said that the administration is conducting an investigation to hold someone accountable.\u000aCarlisle\u2019s response was not sufficient for students who believe writing \u201cTrump\u201d is a racist hate crime and emblematic of \u201cinstitutional racism\u201d at Pitzer. \u201cThe way Administration has failed to classify these incidents as a hate crime has put students of color  safety at risk and has proved to students of color that their safety and well-being is not a priority of this institution,\u201d claims Sarah Roschdi (PZ \u201817). \u201cStudents of color are being directly targeted by pro­trump messages and their [sic] has been zero steps taken to secure the safety and wellbeing of students of color on this campus.\u201d\u000aHaylee Sindt (PZ \u201818) did not agree with Roschdi\u2019s sentiments. \u201cEvery person that has been affected by this, has the absolute right to feel this way,\u201d wrote Sindt. \u201cYou may say that it makes you feel unsafe or that this is a hate crime,\u201d she adds. \u201cHowever\u2026 this is not a hate crime, it was not done to maliciously harass or intimidate \u2018people of color,\u2019 and in no way shape or form should it \u2018negatively and personally impact people.\u2019\u201d\u000a\u201cPlease tell me how the words \u2018Trump\u2019 and \u2018Make America\u2019 is threatening or triggering,\u201d Sindt continues. \u201cWhat would the campus\u2019s reaction be if \u2018Vote for Bernie\u2019 or \u2018Hillary is Awesome\u2019 was written on the mural? Would people still be reacting to the degree to which they are? We all talk about how these colleges are a free space, however, in reality they are not. The second that someone with opposing views, [whose] ideals are vastly out numbered, expresses their opinions, people shut them down, tell them they are wrong, and that they are making them feel \u2018unsafe.\u2019\u201d\u000aSeveral students expressed outrage in response to Sindt\u2019s email. \u201cYour email dismisses the experiences of every person of color on this campus,\u201d Lillian Horin (PZ \u201817) said to Sindt, who is Hispanic. Horin also criticized Sindt\u2019s use of quotation marks around the word unsafe. \u201cDo not trivialize how people of color feel on this campus and in the world around us. We do not feel \u2018unsafe,\u2019 we feel unsafe,\u201d wrote Horin. \u201cJust because you don\u2019t feel it doesn\u2019t mean the rest of us are merely whining. If we feel unsafe, believe us. We have no reason to lie.\u201d Horin added that the words \u2018Trump\u201d and \u201cMake America\u201d are, in fact, racist because \u201cone need only look at his [Trump\u2019s] supporters to see that it is.\u201d\u000a\u201cI am not here to explain stereotypes, micro aggression, white privilege, or systematic oppression to you,\u201d stated Jessica Saint Fleur (PZ \u201818). \u201cIt is no secret that Trump\u2019s campaign is centered around these aspects of oppression. His entire campaign is built on bigotry and hate.\u201d\u000aOne student even accused Sindt of being the one who defaced the mural. \u201cYour tone in your email sounds like you might be/know the person who vandalized the mural,\u201d states Basha Brulee-Wills (PZ\u2019 17). Brulee-Wills then encourages Sindt to think about why she is at Pitzer, \u201cbecause it possibly cannot be that you\u2019re striving to uphold Pitzer\u2019s core values.\u201d\u000aPitzer\u2019s Dean of Students, Moya Carter, shared her opinions regarding on-campus vandalism as well. \u201cThis is not the place to speak to the foolish, embarrassing, hate filled, Islamophobic, fact devoid behavior being represented by some of the candidates running for President of the United States,\u201d wrote Carter in an email to the student body. Just sentences later, Carter claims that \u201cPitzer College is a community that strives for critical thought, diversity of beliefs and freedom of expression.\u201d\u000a\u201cWhen they have nothing better to argue, they immediately accuse someone of being racist,\u201d Sindt told the Claremont Independent. \u201cMany students do not know how to accept what students with differing ideas have to say, so they immediately shut them down. People need to learn that not everyone in life will agree with them.\u201d\u000aShare this:Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)MoreClick to print (Opens in new window)Click to share on Pinterest (Opens in new window)Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)Click to share on Google+ (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Tags: 2016 chalkening chalking claremont donald emory graffiti hate speech Pitzer presidential racism steven glick Trump vandalism violenceCategories: Campus News

aS'Social Justice Warriors Are the Reason Donald Trump Exists'
p539
aVOver the past couple weeks, students at colleges across the country have retreated into their safe spaces to protest the \u201chate speech\u201d that is Donald Trump\u2019s name. Never to be left out of a big PC trend, the Claremont Colleges have seen plenty of oversensitivity to Trump as well. Students and administrators at both Scripps College and  Pitzer College have referred to the phrases \u201c#Trump2016\u201d and \u201cMake America\u201d as \u201charassment,\u201d \u201cintimidation,\u201d and \u201cracism,\u201d among other things. What these students seem to be missing is that their outrage is exactly what has made Trump\u2019s candidacy so successful.\u000aPolitical correctness has reached a point where it is essentially impossible to have an honest, open conversation about sensitive issues. Trump\u2019s rise is nothing more than a direct response to the growing trend of language policing, and nowhere has this pattern of offense-taking victim culture been more evident than right here in Claremont.\u000aAt Pomona College, students protested an America-themed party because they felt that it supported \u201cimperialism, violence, and racist power structures.\u201d A mad scientist-themed party was opposed because the student government felt that the party\u2019s name\u2014\u201cMudd Goes Madd\u201d\u2014\u201ctrivializes mental health and disability issues.\u201d\u000aAt Pitzer College, the Student Senate rejected a proposed Yacht Club because they thought that the word \u201cyacht\u201d was offensive to low-income students. Just weeks later, that same Student Senate did not approve a student\u2019s request to start a campus branch of the national DreamCatcher Foundation\u2014an organization that helps to give happy experiences to terminally ill hospice patients\u2014because, even though the Student Senators believed that it \u201cseems like a worthy organization in their goals and mission,\u201d they were concerned that the word \u201cDreamCatcher\u201d was a form of cultural appropriation. This despite the fact that the CEO of the national organization is Native American herself.\u000aThe administration at Scripps College rescinded its invitation to George Will to speak at the Malott Public Affairs Program, a conservative speaker series intended to provide students with an opportunity to hear viewpoints they disagree with, because they didn\u2019t agree with the conservative views Will expressed in a column he had written for the Washington Post. A cupcake-decorating event at Scripps was criticized for being a \u201cgarbage, cis, white event\u201d and  \u201cincredibly violent to trans women,\u201d and students who defended the event were called \u201cracist.\u201d Just a few weeks later, the same on-campus coffee shop that hosted the cupcake event allowed only \u201cpeople of color and allies that they invite\u201d inside. Minority-only \u201csafe spaces\u201d appeared at Pomona College as well, where students were told that the presence of white students would prevent their nonwhite peers from feeling \u201csafe\u201d and \u201ccomfortable.\u201d\u000aThe political correctness movement is losing traction because students are growing tired of being told what lecturers they can listen to, what parties they can go to, what clubs they can start, what charities they can support, and how they can decorate their cupcakes.\u000aThis same principle applies to most Americans on national political issues. Any opposition to illegal immigration and any efforts to call out radical Islam have been deemed unacceptable by the PC police. Much of Trump\u2019s appeal comes from his brash, unapologetic demeanor and ongoing crudity in the face of public resentment. He maintains his strong views on immigration despite frequently being called a racist by progressives. He is willing to speak out against radical Islamic terror even when his critics try to call him an Islamophobe. He\u2019s the only presidential candidate in American history who can talk about the size of his penis without committing political suicide. The fact that Trump is willing to confront societal taboos and revel in other people\u2019s shock and distaste hits home with those who are tired of rampant PC culture dictating what they can and cannot do with their lives.\u000aOverwhelmingly, Trump is supported by those Americans that feel constantly derided by elites in academia, the media, and Washington, DC. It only confirms Trump\u2019s narrative when students and administrators at some of the most elite, exclusive, and expensive colleges in the country describe the act of writing Trump slogans on campus as \u201chate crimes\u201d and acts of \u201cviolence.\u201d These sorts of reactions communicate to the American working class what Trump has been peddling throughout his campaign: the upper echelons of society find your very presence offensive and they will seek to exclude, or even\u2014in their ideal world\u2014oppress you. How do you imagine that looks to Trump supporters? Every time a social justice warrior tries to call out Donald Trump over supposed bigotry, he, she, they, or ze adds more fuel to the Trump fire. Ah, the irony.\u000a \u000a_________________________________\u000aImage Source: Wikimedia Commons\u000aShare this:Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)MoreClick to print (Opens in new window)Click to share on Pinterest (Opens in new window)Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)Click to share on Google+ (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Tags: claremont donald trump George Will mckenna megan keller mudd pc Pitzer Political Correctness Pomona Scripps steven glickCategories: Opinion

aVA few days ago, I awoke to a mass email from Minjoo Kim, the student body president at Scripps College, condemning a \u201cracist incident\u201d that had taken place the night before. The incident in question? A Mexican-American Scripps student had awoken to find the words \u201c#trump2016\u201d written on the whiteboard on her door. The email claimed that the student was targeted because of her race and described the Trump presidential slogan\u2014nay, hashtag\u2014as an act of violence, and a \u201ctestament that racism continues to be an undeniable problem and alarming threat on our campuses.\u201d This email was followed shortly by a message from our Dean of Students, Charlotte Johnson, chastising those students who believed that Kim\u2019s email had been an overreaction to the incident. Johnson pointed out that Scripps (in theory) respects the First Amendment rights of its students and community members, but that in this case, the \u201ccircumstances are unique.\u201d\u000aSince the same sort of thing happened a week earlier at Emory University, with great cries of racism and threats against students who advocate for particular presidential candidates, it seems that there may be a special, more flexible version of the First Amendment for college administrators.\u000aScripps\u2019 need to constantly respond to hurt feelings and incidences of racism\u2014whether real or imaginary\u2014meant that residents of the dorm where this happened had to go to a mandatory meeting in which Resident Advisors gave out instructions on how to behave if you see something offensive written on a student\u2019s whiteboard. We were told that if we see something \u201coffensive,\u201d we should not erase it; that would be like pretending it never happened. Instead, we\u2019re supposed to take a paper towel and tape it over the offensive message so that others walking down the hall need not be affected (see: triggered) by the message, then report it. Indeed the student who experienced this \u201cact of racism\u201d did not simply erase the whiteboard drawing and move on with her day, she wrote a notice calling attention to her status as a victim, hung it next to the #trump2016 message and posted it on Facebook. The takeaway? At a college for independent women, victimhood bequeaths status. But that\u2019s nothing new.\u000aFor the past few evenings I have been taking part in an immensely detailed congressional simulation, for a government class at neighboring Claremont McKenna College. For this exercise we are simulating a congressional session taking place during the first year of a Donald J. Trump presidency. The simulation has been labor intensive, extremely informative for the students participating, and lots of fun. It plagues me to think that there are students on my campus who would not only be uncomfortable with the simulation, but deeply offended. How is it possible to teach politics and government in an atmosphere like this? How will my classmates survive the upcoming California primary?\u000aPersonally, I am a Cruz supporter. I\u2019m just as perturbed as the next person that Donald Trump is a legitimate candidate for President of the United States. But he is just that, a legitimate candidate. Seeing his name (or a dopey political slogan) should not be enough to send an intelligent college student running for her safe space in tears. Scripps, like most women\u2019s colleges, claims to pride itself on educating and shaping women to bravely go out and face a tough world. Does administrative coddling of behavior like this not devalue the Scripps brand? Surely I cannot be alone in believing this event is an embarrassment, and hopefully not representative of the institution as a whole. I would hate to see my school become another nutty, culturally Marxist institution, pushing this bizarrely weak, fainting couch, victim-feminism. Bizarre and coddled reactions like these legitimize the campaign of someone like Donald J. Trump.\u000a_______________________\u000aImage Source: Flickr\u000aShare this:Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)MoreClick to print (Opens in new window)Click to share on Pinterest (Opens in new window)Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)Click to share on Google+ (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Tags: donald trump Feminism Political Correctness Scripps CollegeCategories: Opinion

aVLast week, Scripps College\u2019s Student Body President, Minjoo Kim, sent an email to the Scripps community describing a \u201cracist incident\u201d that occurred on campus. \u201cA Mexican-American Scripps student woke up to find her whiteboard vandalized with the phrase: \u2018#trump2016\u2019.\u201d A similar incident occurred at Emory University where students felt frightened and disturbed after pro-Donald Trump chalkings appeared on campus with the phrase \u201c#trump2016.\u201d\u000a\u201cThis racist act is completely unacceptable. Regardless of your political party, this intentional violence committed directly to a student of color proves to be another testament that racism continues to be an undeniable problem and alarming threat on our campuses,\u201d the email continues. \u201cCampus Safety has been notified and we hope to find the person responsible so they can be held accountable for their actions.\u201d\u000a\u201cThis is not the inclusive, safe, and welcoming community that we have been striving so hard to create,\u201d notes Kim. \u201cActions and words have consequences. Think before you act.\u201d\u000aDean Charlotte Johnson also addressed the incident with a school-wide email.\u000a\u201cScripps respects the First Amendment rights of its community members, and students who wish to advocate for a political candidate may certainly do so pursuant to all relevant policies and procedures,\u201d Johnson writes. \u201cHowever, while it is true that under most circumstances the mere iteration of a presidential candidate\u2019s name would not be regarded as a form of harassment or intimidation, the circumstances here are unique.\u201d\u000aShe further describes the \u201ccircumstances\u201d by stating, \u201cGiven that the Scripps incident targeted a Mexican-American, who was the only student in her residence hall to discover the message on her door, the negative reaction registered by many members of the community is understandable and far from extreme. As all who have experienced can confirm, racist acts and intimidation are not always overt. But, for their targets such acts are always disconcerting.\u201d\u000aDean Johnson ends her email by declaring, \u201cWe are all responsible for ensuring the Scripps community is a safe place for everyone.\u201d\u000aThe Scripps Guide to Student Life makes no mention of any policies pertaining to whiteboards. Students in all dorms are given public whiteboards placed outside or on their doors, and many leave markers for other students to write on their board with.\u000a_______________________\u000aImage Source: Wikimedia Commons\u000aShare this:Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)MoreClick to print (Opens in new window)Click to share on Pinterest (Opens in new window)Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)Click to share on Google+ (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Tags: 2016 Protest racism racist Scripps College TrumpCategories: Campus News

aS'Scripps Students, Faculty: Protest Madeleine Albright Because She is a \xe2\x80\x98White Feminist\xe2\x80\x99'
p555
aVRecently, the Office of the President at Scripps College sent out an email informing the student body that former U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright will be the commencement speaker this spring. \u201cWe proudly welcome Dr. Albright to Scripps College and eagerly anticipate a glimpse of the person \u2018behind the position\u2019 in her history-making role as America\u2019s first female Secretary of State.\u201d\u000aSeveral students were upset by the decision to invite Dr. Albright to speak at graduation. An article in The Student Life (TSL) described Albright as a \u201cwhite feminist and repeated genocide enabler\u201d because she removed UN peacekeepers and U.S. troops from Rwanda and supported military intervention in the Balkans.\u000aMany other students were concerned by the fact that Albright is white, and expressed their sentiments on social media. \u201c2012 and like 2008 appeared to be people of color. but also SO MANY white women,\u201d a student stated.\u000a\u201c*Just out of curiosity* does anyone know how many POC we\u2019ve had as guest commencement speakers at Scripps? 2\u20263?\u201d asked another student. \u201creal question. real problem,\u201d responded a student who previously stated that she was \u201cfulfilling life dreams\u201d when she saw white feminist Nancy Pelosi speak at Scripps in February.\u000aOne student even called for a protest of the event. \u201cWith Madeline [sic] Albright being our commencement speaker (and a war criminal and a white feminist) I know some of our professors are refusing to be on stage. I was wondering if any of the students were planning a protest or perhaps some sort of show of disagreement with Albright and what she stands for?\u201d\u000aNot all students were angry that Albright was invited to give the commencement speech. \u201cHaving the opportunity to listen to Madeleine Albright speak during commencement is something graduating students, and Scripps students in general, should be appreciative of,\u201d Olivia Wu (SC \u201919) told the Claremont Independent. \u201cSeeing negative reactions about her visit just because of her race is honestly ridiculous when considering her achievements.\u201d\u000aScripps students did not appear to protest when Angela Davis, a leader of the Communist Party USA and member of the Black Panther Party\u2014who was on the FBI\u2019s Top Ten Most Wanted list for murder and kidnapping\u2014spoke on campus earlier this year. The event, titled \u201cRadical Acts: A Conversation with Angela Davis\u201d described Davis as \u201ca one-time Communist party candidate and champion for prison reform\u201d who is \u201can outspoken advocate for the oppressed and exploited, writing on black liberation, prison abolition, the intersections of race, gender, and class, and international solidarity with Palestine.\u201d\u000aScripps\u2019 commencement will take place at the Elm Tree Lawn on Saturday, May 14.\u000a____________________________\u000aImage Source: Wikimedia Commons\u000aShare this:Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)MoreClick to print (Opens in new window)Click to share on Pinterest (Opens in new window)Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)Click to share on Google+ (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Tags: Feminism feminist madeleine albright Protest Scripps College whiteCategories: Campus News Opinion

aS'Dear Citizens Climate Lobby: President Chodosh is Not Obligated to Endorse Your Beliefs on Climate Change'
p559
aVA March 25 article written by Sam Becker for The Student Life (TSL), titled \u201cThe High Price of Not Putting a Price on Carbon,\u201d recounted a meeting between the Citizens Climate Lobby Claremont Colleges (CCLCC) and Claremont McKenna College President Hiram Chodosh. The article condemned Chodosh for declining to \u201csupport a price on carbon on behalf of the college or as an individual\u201d and \u201cattack[ing] the strategy behind the initiative.\u201d Becker states that Chodosh\u2019s \u201clack of support for a price on carbon aligns him with the segment of society who are content to ignore one of the most important issues of our generation,\u201d implying that his decision stems from unwillingness to consider the issue of climate change. However, Chodosh\u2019s choice to not support the students\u2019 proposal is not reprehensible. As the president of a college, Chodosh has no responsibility to take a stance on controversial national political issues\u2014not even under immense student pressure.\u000aAccording to TSL, Chodosh said he wouldn\u2019t support the initiative because \u201cit would be too political, too divisive, and some people may not be pleased with the school.\u201d As Becker mentions in his article, colleges and college presidents historically avoid taking a stance on issues like climate legislation, and this is precisely the reason why. Not only is there still political debate on whether or not human-induced climate change exists, there is also debate among those who are concerned about whether a price on carbon is the correct solution to addressing this issue. If Chodosh had decided to publicly support the initiative, either on behalf of himself or on behalf of the school, CMC would be taking a partisan stance and conveying support for a particular political viewpoint.\u000aThis, of course, would receive pushback from students, alumni, faculty, and others associated with the college that may not share the same views on carbon pricing as CCLCC. Additionally, this would disappoint anyone that believes a non-profit educational institution that consistently encourages discussion and debate across party lines has no business taking political stances on topics not directly related to the school and its functioning. CMC\u2019s mission is to educate its students and improve the quality of education and experience that they have on campus, not to cater to a progressive political agenda.\u000aBecker cites the Wall Street Journal to support his idea that college presidents should actively support specific environmental initiatives. However, the article that he refers to does not argue that colleges should take stances on controversial issues; it simply reports that the higher education lobbyists have had significance in Washington. It makes no mention of any impact that colleges and universities have had on issues beyond those directly related to higher education, like student loans and rules for accrediting schools. There\u2019s a reason why the Journal doesn\u2019t state that colleges should be lobbying other types of legislation: colleges should not be supporting those types of political issues.\u000aChodosh\u2019s advice to the students \u201cto change [their] direction\u201d was right\u2014if their intention is to actually make change, student groups at the Claremont Colleges and other institutions should focus on garnering more support from students and outside organizations for their cause through events like an environmental summit. Trying to receive the support of college officials for specific political issues is not only a request out of their job description, but the precedent that it would set is antithetical to our community value at CMC of welcoming diverse political opinions.\u000aShare this:Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)MoreClick to print (Opens in new window)Click to share on Pinterest (Opens in new window)Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)Click to share on Google+ (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Tags: Chodosh citizens climate global warming lobby president teagan knightCategories: Opinion

aS'To survive, the GOP must stop Trump'
p563
aVMany journalists and political commentators have already opined on the problems which would accompany the selection of Donald J. Trump as the Republican Party\u2019s nominee for the highest office in the land. Many conservatives are concerned that Mr. Trump would lose to Hillary Clinton in the general election, given his poor poll numbers against the former secretary of state. A survey conducted this week in Utah, a state which has voted Republican in every presidential contest since 1968, revealed that Trump would narrowly lose the state in a one-on-one matchup against Secy. Clinton.\u000aOthers have argued that Mr. Trump, whose juvenile humor and penchant for personal assaults have attracted much attention this election cycle, lacks the temperament to become president. Vanity Fair even published a piece which sought to characterize Mr. Trump\u2019s demeanor and public statements as evidence of narcissistic personality disorder. And conservative writer George Will has discussed how Trump\u2019s lack of fealty to conservative principles will cause the Republican Party to suffer defeat in November against Hillary Clinton.\u000aYet Mr. Trump\u2019s supporters would dismiss these criticisms, at least in part. On the first point, general election polls this early in the presidential election have little predictive value. An article published in 2007 by the Pew Research Center explained that early general election matchups \u201care mostly wrong about who will win the White House,\u201d and an extensive analysis by political scientists Christopher Wlezian and Robert Erikson of general election polling has shown that \u201cpolls from the beginning of the election year have virtually no predictive power.\u201d1 Wlezian and Erikson\u2019s examination also concluded that it is not until April that general election polls begin to carry some meaningful predictive value, but even then, they are only mildly predictive of the eventual outcome. Therefore, although Mr. Trump has performed the worst of all the other Republican presidential candidates in head-to-head general election matchups thus far, we should take these results with a grain of salt, at least for now, and not dismiss the New York businessman out of hand.\u000aOn the second point, though Trump does have his (many) moments of infantile behavior, he has demonstrated at least some capacity to restrain himself and act presidential. We saw this occur in the most recent Republican debate, where the Donald largely refrained from attacking his opponents, and in the businessman\u2019s speech at the American Israel Public Affairs Committee\u2019s conference this week. Attempting to characterize Mr. Trump\u2019s ego as some kind of mental disorder or incapacity, as Vanity Fair attempted to do, is nothing more than tabloid journalism.\u000aSupporters of Mr. Trump would also argue that George Will\u2019s critique of the brash businessman\u2019s conservative credentials misses the mark. In general elections, partisan candidates suffer the consequences of their brinksmanship at the ballot box unless they manage to convince moderates to come aboard. Mitt Romney, for example, drew a higher percentage of conservatives to the polls in 2012 than did Ronald Reagan in his 1980 election victory, but Mr. Romney\u2019s poor performance among moderates\u2014whom he lost by 15 points\u2014cost him the election. Assuming that Donald Trump can obtain the GOP nomination, his moderate and liberal policy positions\u2014such as his support for federal funding of Planned Parenthood\u2014will only help him in a national election, where a centrist electorate decides the outcome.\u000aThough I could summon a bevy of counterarguments to refute these points, let us assume for a moment that Trump\u2019s supporters are correct on all three counts. Let\u2019s assume that the general elections polls right now, which almost all show the Donald getting trounced by Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders, are not predictive of the outcome on November 8th, 2016. Let\u2019s presume also that Donald Trump is well-suited for the presidency, having the temperament and the judgment to be the leader of the free world, and that his moderate ideological dispositions might actually help him defeat the Democratic nominee for president by attracting centrist voters to his candidacy.\u000aEven if all of these assumptions are held to be true, Republicans should still fight tooth-and-nail to defeat Donald Trump because his victory would fundamentally undermine the Republican Party and its critical role in American democracy.\u000aPolitical parties are important for two main reasons. First, they represent particular visions of how society is and how it should be. Parties make it possible for voters to choose between these different perspectives\u2014for example, between the desires for a smaller or a larger government\u2014without necessarily knowing everything that there is to know about every single candidate who runs for public office. In other words, parties enable a voter to make an educated choice at the ballot box simply by casting his ballot for the candidate who identifies herself with the political party\u2014and the political philosophy\u2014which the voter himself finds agreeable. Second, by attaching holders of public office to distinct philosophical frameworks, political parties make the government comprehensible to its citizens. It would be impossible to make sense of Congress if the viewpoints of its 535 members could not be grouped by some sort of political party affiliation. When we say that the U.S. House of Representatives is currently controlled by Republicans, we are conveying something meaningful about the ideological makeup of the House as an institution and about the values and philosophies of its individual members.\u000aBut in order to realize these benefits, political parties must nominate presidential candidates who represent their values. If they fail to do so, the particular vision which the party represents will crumble into a confused mess as the nominee, who stands as the ostensible representative of the ideals of the party, presents a set of fundamental principles which directly clash with the views that he is supposed to defend. And though Donald Trump claims to embrace some conservative views, his most important policy ideas sharply contrast with the GOP\u2019s core doctrine. Of all seventeen of the initial contenders for the Republican presidential nomination, Donald Trump is the only one who has categorically opposed any reforms of Social Security or Medicare. In a party which stands for a strong national defense, Mr. Trump has raised doubts as to whether the U.S. should remain in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO)\u2014the \u201cbackbone of Western security policies since the Cold War\u201c\u2014and has intimated that he would remove American support for South Korea and Japan, which he sees as free-riders on the U.S.\u2019s commitments in the Asia-Pacific region.2 He is a strong proponent of eminent domain3, a practice which conservatives regard as a transgression of our most fundamental property rights. And most notably, Donald Trump has railed against free trade agreements with Mexico, Japan, and other countries, saying that he would \u201crenegotiate or break\u201d the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) and oppose the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) as president. Yet the last Republican Party platform hailed the TPP as an opportunity to \u201copen Asian markets to U.S. products\u201d and even proposed a \u201cworldwide multilateral agreement among nations committed to the principles of open markets.\u201d\u000aIf the decidedly not conservative Donald Trump wins the Republican nomination, the party will be too hopelessly divided to articulate a clear vision of what it stands for in the months before the November general election. At his current pace, if Trump manages to clinch the nomination, he will do so without winning a majority of the popular vote. Yet as the party\u2019s standard bearer, he would become the chief representative of the conservative worldview, a worldview against which he has openly rebelled throughout his campaign. This dissonance would ultimately lead to disaster, as most general election voters would conflate Mr. Trump\u2019s views\u2014particularly his unpopular stances on undocumented and Muslim immigration\u2014with those of the Republican Party, even if most conservatives in fact strenuously disagree with his policies. And as the GOP\u2019s fundamental philosophical tenets are pulled into his orbit, Republican candidates for public office all across the country would either have to renounce their party membership\u2014thereby tacitly acknowledging that Mr. Trump is indeed accurately representing the GOP\u2019s principles\u2014or furiously deny that Donald Trump is in fact representative of their particular views on the issues or of the Republican Party as a whole. But with voters demonstrating an increasing tendency to vote for the same party in down-ballot elections as they do in the presidential contest, these arguments are unlikely to have much of an effect.\u000aEven beyond the 2016 election, nominating Donald Trump would have severe repercussions for the Republican Party. As America\u2019s population has become more and more diverse, the GOP has painstakingly worked to expand its outreach in minority communities and become more inclusive. Selecting Mr. Trump would upend all of that hard work and indicate that the party is willing to stand with a person who has called for barring all Muslims from entering the United States, who has promised to carry out the indiscriminate mass deportation of 11 million illegal immigrants, and who condones violence against protestors at his campaign rallies and stump speeches. If the GOP has any desire to survive beyond this November, it must defeat Donald Trump at all costs and resoundingly reject his poisonous rhetoric.\u000aFootnotes

aS'Super Tuesday 2.0: The fallout from the March 15th primaries'
p567
aVOn the Republican side\u000aDonald Trump marched to victory in four of the five Republican primaries on Tuesday, steamrolling Senator Marco Rubio on his home turf in Florida and holding back an insurgent Senator Ted Cruz in Missouri, Illinois, and North Carolina. His only loss came in Ohio, where John Kasich, the state\u2019s popular governor, won handily. After his disappointing loss in Florida, Marco Rubio suspended his campaign, shrinking the GOP field to three candidates.\u000aThe only certainty coming out of Tuesday\u2019s primaries is that the uncertainty of the GOP race will persist for some time. Donald Trump had a good night, but it was not quite decisive enough to make his nomination a foregone conclusion. His dominant performance in Florida, though bringing him 99 delegates closer to winning the nomination outright, also pushed Marco Rubio out of the race and strengthened Mr. Trump\u2019s opponents. According to a new national poll by Morning Consult, nearly half of Rubio supporters back Mr. Cruz as their second-choice candidate, while just one in eight view the Donald as their best alternative. A little more than a quarter would support John Kasich. Taken in the context of Trump\u2019s razor-thin margins of victory in Missouri and North Carolina, where he won by 0.2 percent and 4 percent respectively, these numbers indicate that Mr. Rubio\u2019s political demise may compromise Donald Trump in the long run, giving just enough strength to Cruz and Kasich to mount serious challenges to Mr. Trump in critical states like Arizona, New York, and Pennsylvania.\u000aThough posting strong performances in all of Tuesday\u2019s primaries, Donald Trump failed once again to demonstrate his ability to expand his appeal beyond his narrow, impassioned core group of supporters. Though he did manage to exceed his average vote share from the previous contests, the New York real estate mogul was yet again unable to obtain a majority in a single state. The longer he fails to exceed the 50 percent mark in these primary races, the more time will pass before he will be able to credibly claim that he is a consensus candidate who can unite the party, and the more opportunities Messrs. Cruz and Kasich will have to topple Mr. Trump before he can clinch the Republican nomination.\u000aBeyond Tuesday, Mr. Trump will need to win just under 60 percent of the remaining 975 delegates in order to clinch the GOP nomination. With winner-take-all and winner-take-most states dominating the rest of the primary season, his path to the nomination is realistic but far from secure. In order to clinch the nomination and avoid ejection at a contested convention, Mr. Trump will need to string together victories in several of the upcoming winner-take-all and winner-take-most primaries and overcome his narrow appeal within the Republican electorate.\u000a \u000aOn the Democratic side\u000a After a shocking defeat in Michigan on March 8th, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton redeemed herself with a dominant performance in Tuesday\u2019s Democratic primaries. She swept every state, taking Florida, North Carolina, and Ohio by comfortable margins and fending off fierce challenges from Senator Bernie Sanders in Missouri and Illinois. Though winning the nomination is still a statistical possibility for Mr. Sanders, his performance on Tuesday has made his practical path to the nomination impossibly narrow.\u000aUnlike the Republican Party, which permits states to award delegates on a winner-take-all or a winner-take-most basis, the Democratic Party only allows its primaries to award delegates proportionally. This feature makes late comebacks difficult, since overcoming a large delegate deficit in proportional primaries requires not only victories but also wide margins of victory, like those which Mrs. Clinton has produced throughout the South. With Clinton now leading by over 300 pledged delegates and 400 superdelegates, Mr. Sanders will be hard-pressed to come up with the massive wins he will need in order to shift the balance of the Democratic race and overtake his opponent. Barring an extraordinary change in the state of the race\u2014such as the indictment of Mrs. Clinton over her alleged mishandling of classified documents as secretary of state\u2014Bernie Sanders will not be the Democratic Party\u2019s nominee for president.\u000a_________________________________\u000aImage Source: Flickr\u000aShare this:Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)MoreClick to print (Opens in new window)Click to share on Pinterest (Opens in new window)Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)Click to share on Google+ (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Tags: Bernie Caucus Clinton donald election election 2016 Hillary kasich primaries primary Sanders ted cruz TrumpCategories: National News

aS'Pitzer Students Vote To Ban Bottled Water'
p575
aVOn Sunday evening, the Pitzer College Student Senate voted unanimously to ban bottled water on its campus. In its official statement, the Senate affirmed:\u000a\u201cThe Pitzer College Student Senate recommends that the College take the necessary steps to discontinue the purchase, sale and distribution of bottled water on campus and at College sanctioned events, including vending machines and campus cafes and eateries\u2026 the Pitzer College Student Senate recommends that the College provides reusable water vessels for all members of the Pitzer community, including staff and faculty members.\u201d\u000aThe document does not articulate what Pitzer College\u2019s current bottled water consumption is, nor does it identify the impact of such a ban. While the Senate presented a myriad of reasons for its rejection of bottled water, its primary concern involved the environmental impacts of bottled water. \u201cAmericans used about 50 billion plastic water bottles last year, yet the recycled rate for plastic in the United States is only 23%, which means 38 billion water bottles \u2013 more than $1 billion worth of plastic \u2013 are wasted each year,\u201d the Pitzer Senate argued. \u201cPublic tap water is regulated by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), which requires multiple daily tests for bacteria and releases this information to the public, while the Food and Drug Administration, who regulate bottled water, only requires weekly testing and does not share its findings with the general public (National Resource Defense Council).\u201d\u000aPitzer College reasoned that a college-wide ban on water bottles would reduce the American footprint on the environment and increase the quality of the consumed water. However, when the University of Vermont enacted a similar ban in 2013, students still bought water bottles online and had them shipped to campus, creating an even greater environmental footprint than before the ban. Furthermore, student consumption of unhealthy sugary drinks increased by 25% as students sought alternatives to bottled water. When debating this policy, the Pitzer College Senate did not identify the economic and environmental costs of such a ban.\u000aMany other schools, including the University of California at Berkeley, Cornell University, and Brown University have banned bottled water for similar concerns. When Harvard was debating banning bottled water, one student wrote in the Harvard Crimson a defense of keeping plastic water bottles legal, arguing that a better solution would be to raise the prices on plastic water bottles, creating an incentive to use eco-friendly materials without coercion. The argument proceeds, that \u201cthe University could then use some of the tax revenues to supplement employee pay to ensure that the tax does not result in lower salaries for student-employees.\u201d In this context, Pitzer\u2019s ban on water bottles could hurt the dining hall workers\u2019 salaries or increase student fees due to lost economic revenue. \u000aOver this past Academic Year, the Pitzer Senate has repeatedly curtailed liberties within the college in the name of social justice. Last fall, the Senate voted to forbid students from forming a yacht club because it deemed the word \u201cyacht\u201d to be \u201coffensive\u201d and \u201cclassist.\u201d Shortly thereafter, the Senate refused funding to a proposed Pitzer College branch of the DreamCatchers Foundation, a charity that works with terminally ill hospice patients. The Senate reasoned that though the founders and current owners of the DreamCatchers Foundation were Native Americans themselves, the organization was deemed \u201ccultural appropriation.\u201d Pitzer College\u2019s self-proclaimed mission, \u201cenvironmental sustainability [and] social responsibility\u201d has now manifested itself through this ban.\u000aThe ban on bottled water comes to Pitzer even though bottled water is safer than tap water in the event of a natural disaster. As the Claremont Colleges are located near the San Andreas fault, it is wise to take the threat of earthquakes seriously. Moreover, the ban on bottled water is not accompanied by bans on other eco-unfriendly materials, such as aluminum soda cans, or non-fair trade chocolate and coffee. The Pitzer Senate articulated that \u201cproducing single use disposable bottles to meet America\u2019s demand for bottled water uses more than 17 million barrels of oil annually\u201d without identifying the impact of alternatives. The Pitzer Senate mandated that Pitzer College \u201cinstall more hydration stations\u201d and \u201cprovide reusable water bottles for all members of the Pitzer Community, including staff and faculty\u201d, but did not articulate the funding source for such endeavors.\u000a \u000a______________________\u000aImage Source: Flickr\u000aShare this:Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)MoreClick to print (Opens in new window)Click to share on Pinterest (Opens in new window)Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)Click to share on Google+ (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Tags: Environment Pitzer College Pitzer Senate Social JusticeCategories: Campus News

aS'Sexual Assault Accusations Enter the 21st Century'
p579
aVSexual assault continues to be in the spotlight at the 5Cs, mostly as a result of the continued activism of Pomona College students and the proactivity of the administration. During the 2015 Pomona College Commencement ceremony, a majority of students graduating turned their backs to Pomona College president David Oxtoby to protest the allegedly poor treatment of sexual assault victims. In response to these protests, Oxtoby sent out a letter to students on June 3rd announcing new initiatives to improve the response to sexual assault reports, allegations, and prosecution.\u000aOne initiative in particular stands out: the adoption of Callisto, an online reporting system for sexual assault victims that serves as a complaint escrow. Simply put, this software allows sexual assault victims to record an incident\u2019s details on a third-party device and safeguard it for future use. Callisto provides many features, including immediately reporting an incident, reporting the incident information when a second claim surfaces against the same attacker, or deleting the report if the victim decides against reporting the assault. The report includes any level of detail that the victim chooses to share, and has the option to submit reports to college administration and/or law enforcement. Only the parties involved in the case have access to the information which prevents mismanagement of student records. Falsified reports can also be prevented since suspicious reporting patterns and inconsistent information is kept on record once it is submitted.\u000aJessica Ladd (PO \u201907) started development of Callisto in 2011 to reduce negative sexual assault reporting experiences and to collect details about sexual assault incidents. Since Callisto reduces contact with administration, the chances of a bad reporting experience are greatly reduced. This should lead to higher sexual assault reporting rates on college campuses.\u000aCallisto also allows for data collection on sexual assault incidents. Even with just two founding institutions adopting Callisto for the 2015-2016 school year, the software provides the opportunity to collect reliable statistics for sexual assaults on college campuses. Better statistics lead to better research and better problem-solving for campuses willing to address the problem. Access to reliable data in future studies can help colleges and universities assess the effects of Callisto and other sexual assault initiatives, keep track of sexual assault rates on campuses, and discover initiatives that prioritize the safety of students.\u000aThe Callisto interface has many benefits, but also exacerbates the flaws already present in the sexual assault reporting process. Falsified accusations can be submitted anonymously through thoughtful coordination without ever lying to an administrator\u2019s face. Students could also submit reports on a whim against someone who offered a disappointing sexual experience or other various misgivings. Although falsified sexual assault reports are uncommon, the possibility of framing a student as part of a grudge and making them deal with the Title IX process for sexual assault accusations can be very burdensome for the accused, even if the student is found innocent.\u000aOn the other hand, Callisto can also be used to collect suspicious and deliberate attempts to unjustly incriminate students. Reports against a student that are all submitted to Callisto at the same time, for example, could be a scenario deemed as a falsified report. As mentioned earlier, inconsistent data from sexual assault reports is also compiled and can be used against malicious Callisto users. The actual effects of whether false reporting would change with Callisto are uncertain at best.\u000aPomona College is one of the most progressive college campuses in the country when it comes to addressing sexual assault. It is my hope that future data and analysis from Callisto will help us determine the magnitude of sexual assaults on campus and the steps necessary to address the problem across the nation. It is also my hope that we avoid the slippery slope of falsely accusing students of sexual assault based on a grudge or for a consensual but unpleasant time.\u000aStudents must also learn the difference between a sexual assault and a poor experience with intimate partners. Most students will go through experiences that they regret or undertake without proper judgement on both sides, but these experiences do not necessarily justify a sexual assault report. Even with very inefficient sexual assault reporting processes at colleges and the unfair treatment of victims through the Title IX process, Callisto can help streamline the process of sexual assault cases or even circumvent schools and go directly to law enforcement. The premise of \u201cinnocent until proven guilty\u201d should be upheld throughout any type of adjudication by colleges and universities. Callisto will help maintain factual accuracy and give both the accuser and the accused an equal opportunity to present their cases.\u000aShare this:Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)MoreClick to print (Opens in new window)Click to share on Pinterest (Opens in new window)Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)Click to share on Google+ (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Tags: app apps College report reporting reports Sexual AssaultCategories: Campus News Opinion

aS'President Oxtoby to Step Down'
p583
aVIn an email sent this morning to the Pomona College community, David W. Oxtoby \u2013 thirteen year President of Pomona College \u2013 announced his plans to step down in June 2017.\u000aPresident Oxtoby states that he is \u201cvery proud of Pomona College.\u201d In particular, he references \u201cthe successful conclusion of Campaign Pomona: Daring Minds,\u201d a five-year, $250 million fundraising effort that has contributed to new construction projects like those of the Studio Art Center and Millikan Hall, as well as increased funding for internships, fellowships, and scholarships.\u000aHe further assures the community: \u201cWhile I am considering opportunities I might pursue, my highest priority will remain leading this amazing institution in the months ahead. I am confident that the leadership and expertise of our faculty, the experience of our staff, the determination and talent of our students, and the time we have to partner together on the shared goals will make this a smooth transition and allow us to remain focused on the critical work still at hand.\u201d With the support from the Board, President Oxtoby plans to continue advancing \u201cthe College\u2019s key priorities and successful operations of the institution.\u201d\u000aThis advancement will include \u201cworking to improve diversity and inclusion, developing plans for the new Pomona College Museum of Art, progressing [Pomona\u2019s] commitment to be climate neutral by 2030, and taking the next steps to further integrate the new Sontag Center for Collaborative Creativity into The Claremont Colleges.\u201d\u000aPresident Oxtoby closes by urging the college to \u201ccontinue to move ahead, celebrating the meaningful work we do here every day and exploring exciting opportunities for the future.\u201d\u000aSam Glick, Chair of the Pomona College Board of Trustees, emailed the Pomona College community following President Oxtoby\u2019s announcement, stating that \u201cWe will celebrate President Oxtoby\u2019s many contributions to the College in due course.  For now, however, both President Oxtoby and the Board of Trustees have plenty of work to do.  Every year that he has led the College, President Oxtoby has moved our institution forward with characteristic energy and ambition.  I expect his final year to be no exception, and he has the full support of the Board of Trustees in continuing to advance Pomona\u2019s mission.\u201d\u000aMr. Glick continues: \u201cMeanwhile, the Board of Trustees must begin the important task of choosing President Oxtoby\u2019s successor.  Selecting a new leader is the highest duty a governing body has \u2013 a duty that my colleagues on the Board and I intend to carry out with humility and careful deliberation.  Over the next month or so, we will design a process to select the tenth president of Pomona College.  While we will share more specifics regarding that process in April, I know that it will reflect Pomona\u2019s long tradition of shared governance, and, as with previous presidential searches, will take into account the perspectives and priorities of Pomona\u2019s diverse community, including faculty, staff, students and alumni.\u201d\u000aMr. Glick concludes by assuring the Pomona College community that \u201cPomona has never been in a stronger position to recruit a new president, and President Oxtoby\u2019s transition presents us with a valuable moment in which we can reflect as a community on who we are, who we want to be, and how a new leader can support us on that journey.\u201d\u000a_____________________\u000aImage Source: Wikimedia Commons\u000aShare this:Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)MoreClick to print (Opens in new window)Click to share on Pinterest (Opens in new window)Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)Click to share on Google+ (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Tags: 2017 claremont oxtoby Pomona President Oxtoby resignCategories: Campus News

aS'Super Tuesday: Go Big or Go Home'
p587
aVWhat is Super Tuesday?\u000aSince our last feature on the Iowa Caucuses, four states, Iowa, New Hampshire, South Carolina, and Nevada have all cast their votes for both the Republican and Democratic Presidential nominees, respectively. With two caucuses and two primaries, these early voting states represent each region of the United States: the Midwest, the Northeast, the South, and the Far West. Both the RNC and the DNC set rules for when states can hold their primary elections, and excluding these four exemptions no states are allowed to hold primaries or caucuses in the month of February. Washington also held its Republican caucus for local elections earlier this month, but the state doesn\u2019t vote to bind its delegates to a Presidential candidate until the subsequent primary in May. Typically, the earlier a state casts its votes, the more influence it holds in the nomination process.\u000aStates and territories from all over the US are holding primaries and caucuses on Super Tuesday, including Arkansas, Georgia, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Oklahoma, Tennessee, Texas, Vermont, and Virginia. Alaska and Wyoming will hold their Republican caucuses, and American Samoa will vote for a Democratic candidate. Super Tuesday is a landmark day in the election season because it almost always determines who ends up winning the nomination and how much longer the primary season will last. The joint predictive power of the four earliest states is dubious because they constitute a mere 4% of the voters in each party. Only one of the fifty largest cities in the US \u2013 Las Vegas \u2013 lies in these four states. By the end of Super Tuesday, 32% of Republicans and 26% of Democrats will have cast their primary ballots.\u000aUnlike the primaries and caucuses in the early states, Super Tuesday has massive predictive power. In 2008, Sen. John McCain won crucial races in California and Illinois, and won all of the delegates from New Jersey and New York. Pres. Obama narrowly won Super Tuesday over Senator Clinton. Though he went on to win the election, Super Tuesday\u2019s extremely narrow margin correctly forbade a long, drawn-out race that would divide the Democrats until late May of that year. Sen. McCain and Pres. Obama aren\u2019t the only examples of the predictive power of Super Tuesday; Gov. Romney in 2012, Sen. Kerry in 2004, Pres. Bush in 2000, Vice Pres. Al Gore in 2000, Sen. Dole in 1996, and Pres. Bill Clinton in 1992 all won their Super Tuesday contests and were the eventual nominees. In other words, precedent dictates that it is highly unlikely that a candidate will lose Super Tuesday and subsequently win the nomination.\u000a \u000aWhat does Super Tuesday mean for the Democrats?\u000aHillary Clinton has won three of the past four primaries and is consistently polling slightly ahead of Senator Bernie Sanders. While neither candidate has a clear lead in national polling, Hillary Clinton is doing particularly well with the Super Tuesday states. With the notable exception of Vermont \u2013 Sanders\u2019 home state \u2013 Clinton is leading in nearly every other state slated to vote on March 1. To stay in the race, Sanders needs victories in Massachusetts and Minnesota. Sanders knows that a loss in Nevada significantly hurt his campaign, and has his eye on Super Tuesday.\u000aThe majority of the Super Tuesday delegates will be awarded by states in the South: Arkansas, Georgia, Oklahoma, Tennessee, Texas, and Virginia. While most of these states are traditionally Republican, their Democratic bases are largely African-American \u2013 a group that supports Secretary Clinton. The recent South Carolina primary indicated Hillary\u2019s popularity with Southern Democrats, and pundits expect other southern primaries to reveal similar results. To his credit, Sanders knew that South Carolina wasn\u2019t going his way and did not spend significant resources on winning the state. In spite of controversy surrounding Secretary Clinton\u2019s record on civil rights, the hashtag #WhichHillary does not seem to have whittled down her support base in the south. To this end, Sanders\u2019 winning strategy involves him mitigating his losses in the South and winning the non-southern races. Because of the delegate-heavy South, Sanders is slated to lose Super Tuesday. Nevertheless, Sanders could very well be the first presidential candidate to lose Super Tuesday and go on to win the nomination if he performs better in the rest of the country.\u000a \u000aWhat does Super Tuesday mean for the Republicans?\u000aDonald Trump has won three of the four early Republican primaries, and is currently polling ahead in all 11 of the states casting their votes on Super Tuesday, aside from Texas where Ted Cruz is showing a single digit lead. Uniform third choice Marco Rubio who has won no primaries thus far, and did not fare as well as expected in his childhood state of Nevada is not currently leading a single Super Tuesday state. However, he is second seed in several states including Virginia and Massachusetts. Rubio and his campaign have assured us all that \u201cearly polls really don\u2019t matter.\u201d But do they? Historically, the first four primary states may or may not be indicative of who the Republican party will nominate for President. Because Super Tuesday has not predicted an incorrect winner for the party nomination in the relevant past, if Donald J. Trump walks away the clear winner on March 1, the odds are overwhelming that he will go on to become the Republican party nominee for President of the United States.\u000aThe day (or week) after Super Tuesday is often a time when we see the field of potential nominees narrow itself. On the day after Super Tuesday in 2000, John McCain suspended his campaign, allowing George W. Bush to continue on alone to the Republican convention to receive the party\u2019s official nomination. Perhaps this year we will see the end of the ailing campaign of Dr. Ben Carson.\u000aIn examining his proposed tax policies and inconsistent responses on both abortion and gay marriage, Donald Trump is undoubtedly the closest Republican to the middle. He has the overwhelming support of moderate Republicans, even in spite of Kasich and Rubio\u2019s perceptions as establishment Republicans. Ted Cruz is far more conservative than either Rubio or Trump, and Rubio sits in between the two. When Chris Christie, a relatively moderate Republican, dropped out of the race, he endorsed Donald Trump. Rubio supporters are more likely to pick Trump as their second choice than Cruz supporters. Between Rubio and Cruz, Trump will benefit more if Rubio drops out than if Cruz drops out. Trump is more likely to win a Trump/Cruz matchup than a Trump/Rubio matchup.\u000a_________________\u000aImage Source: JSTOR Daily\u000aShare this:Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)MoreClick to print (Opens in new window)Click to share on Pinterest (Opens in new window)Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)Click to share on Google+ (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Tags: 2016 Bernie Cruz donald election Hillary marco primary Rubio Sanders super tuesday ted TrumpCategories: Feature

aS'I Resign: The Writing Center\xe2\x80\x99s Mission is to Teach Writing, Not Ideology'
p591
aVDear Professor Bromley, Ms. Liu-Rojas, and Ms. Snell,\u000aI am writing to resign my position as a Writing Fellow. I wish that I felt I could continue in this role and am sorry to resign mid-year. As you know, writing is one of my passions and as you also know, that wasn\u2019t always the case. It was my freshman seminar that convinced me I could write and that I enjoyed it. My professor, Dean Lozano, was instrumental in that process, and his Writing Fellow, Ben Brasch, was key as well. At the conclusion of the course, I decided to apply to become a Writing Fellow in the hope that I could inspire other writers the way I had been inspired. I was thrilled and honored to be selected to serve as a Fellow.\u000aI had genuinely thought the purpose of the Writing Center was to teach writing. I hadn\u2019t realized the writing instruction would be delivered with a side of ideology and that the ideology was not only mandatory but also more important than the actual teaching of writing. I\u2019ve learned this over the past few months, which is the reason for my resignation.\u000aFirst, Ms. Snell, the Writing Center Team Coordinator, asked me to meet with her. She accused me of being an obstacle preventing the Writing Center from being a \u201csafe space.\u201d This came in response to a news article I had written that detailed a series of no-whites-allowed \u201csafe spaces\u201d at the Claremont Colleges. Ms. Snell specifically mentioned my article, and noted she was concerned that my involvement with both the Writing Center and the Claremont Independent would lead students to associate the organizations with one another. Obviously, many other Writing Fellows contribute to campus publications. But as far as I\u2019m aware, no one else has been told that\u2019s a problem.\u000aMy next meeting was with Professor Bromley. She told me she was worried that I was not doing enough to make the Writing Center a space where students feel welcome. To rectify that, she canceled my appointments that night and asked me to read three packets about identity politics instead. One of the readings states that teaching English to non-native English speakers is an attack on free speech. Another criticizes \u201cthe hegemonic feminist theory produced by academic women, most of whom were white.\u201d The third, titled \u201cHeteropatriarchy and the Three Pillars of White Supremacy,\u201d states that capitalism is racist. I read all three packets, as I had been told to do. I did not agree with the opinions presented in any of them, nor did I see any connection between these readings and my work at the Writing Center.\u000aMs. Snell then asked to meet with me again to talk about what I had read, and what role identity politics should play in the Writing Center\u2019s mission. My peers have proposed their ideas for a new Writing Center mission statement, noting that we should aspire to \u201cprovide a space for students to work through their ideas with fellows trained in a writing pedagogy that considers how race, gender, sexuality, language, national-origin, and socioeconomic status influences and affects those ideas,\u201d \u201ceducate ourselves so that we better understand oppression, liberation, and dynamics of difference and power as they manifest themselves in the Writing Center,\u201d and \u201cacknowledge and interrogate the ways in which the Writing Center, Pomona College, and academia itself perpetuate and have perpetuated injustice and oppression.\u201d I told Ms. Snell that, in my opinion, the goal of the Writing Center should remain unchanged: to provide \u201cstudents with a community of experienced readers and writers, offering free, one-on-one consultations at any stage of the writing process\u2014from generating a thesis and structuring an argument to fine-tuning a draft.\u201d\u000aI guess that was the wrong answer, since the next day I was placed on probation and informed that I needed to meet with Professor Bromley and Ms. Liu-Rojas, the Writing Center\u2019s administrative assistant, the following week. I was told the reason for my probation was that I had missed a mandatory meeting for Writing Fellows, but at my meeting with Professor Bromley and Ms. Liu-Rojas, we did not discuss that at all. Rather, we talked about my prior meeting with Ms. Snell. Apparently, \u201cher feelings had been hurt\u201d because of my \u201ctone.\u201d Professor Bromley and Ms. Liu-Rojas told me that if I did anything else they deemed wrong, I would be fired.\u000aThe following night, I worked my normal shift. I met with two students and I thought that both consultations had gone well. However, I soon received an email from Professor Bromley stating that the Writing Center had received an \u201canonymous complaint\u201d from a student who had worked with me, that they were investigating the situation, and that my appointments would be canceled until further notice. Perhaps coincidentally, a quick Facebook search revealed that one of the students with whom I worked that night had dressed as \u201cWhite Supremacy\u201d for Halloween and appeared in photos with two other students who were dressed as \u201cSteven Glick and his White Fragility,\u201d yet she still chose to work with me as her tutor.\u000aBased on these incidents, which have occurred over many months, it has become clear that the Writing Center is harassing me because of my political beliefs. This is unacceptable, just as harassment based on gender, race, religion or any other demographic or ideological construct is unacceptable. My probation is not related to any inadequacy of my work at the Writing Center. Rather, it is due to my political views, which differ greatly from those of the Writing Center leadership. Each time I have been asked to meet with Writing Center leadership, I am asked to talk about controversial political issues that are unrelated to my work at the Center. Soon after each meeting, I have been informed I\u2019ve done something wrong on the job and need to be punished. I had hoped that President Oxtoby\u2019s recent statement in support of free speech at Pomona College would be a game changer, allowing conservative, libertarian, and classically liberal students and faculty to share our honest opinions with our progressively liberal peers who seem to control the sanctioned conversation on campus. Unfortunately, I was naively optimistic. His words carry no meaning if they are ignored and countermanded by Pomona\u2019s faculty and staff.\u000aI wish I could continue to work at the Writing Center because I feel that it\u2019s important for all students, whether black or white, on financial aid or not, conservative or liberal, to have a place to review and strengthen their writing. Unfortunately, the Writing Center no longer seems to be that place. Until the Writing Center can return to its apolitical mission and forsake its acceptance and appeasement of political harassment, I regret that I must resign my position as a Writing Fellow.\u000aSincerely,\u000aSteven Glick\u000aEditor-in-Chief, The Claremont Independent\u000aShare this:Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)MoreClick to print (Opens in new window)Click to share on Pinterest (Opens in new window)Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)Click to share on Google+ (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Tags: Claremont Independent pomona college resign steven glick writing centerCategories: Editorial

aS'Pomona Students: Campus Safety Tips Are \xe2\x80\x98Rape Culture\xe2\x80\x99'
p595
aVOn Monday evening, the Claremont University Consortium Campus Safety Office sent out a message warning Claremont students about a potential rash of Xanax and other drug-laced drinks at recent CMC parties.\u000a\u201cOver the past two weeks, the Dean of Students Office of Claremont McKenna College (CMC) has received information that three on-campus parties may have involved students providing Xanax-laced or Rohypnol-laced drinks. While this information is unconfirmed, the allegations alone are serious enough that I wanted to alert our students of what CMC has heard.  We will continue to investigate these allegations, as such behavior is highly concerning to all of us, dangerous to those who consume the drinks, violates the Student Code of Conduct, and cannot and will not be tolerated.\u201d\u000aClaremont McKenna College, among other colleges, has enacted policies restricting unabridged alcohol usage on campus. Such policies have been geared at breaking up large unregistered parties due to safety concerns. CMC has also promoted its \u201cTeal Dot Training Program\u201d, a program that coaches would-be bystanders to intervene in dangerous scenarios and has held forums related to Title IX policy and the responsible use of alcohol on campus. Thomas Schalke (CMC \u201818), a student on the Personal and Social Responsibility Committee for Campus Climate tells the Claremont Independent \u201cIn concert with a wide range of other solutions, the college is committed to expanding access to preventative programs such as Teal Dot and more fully integrating them into the student experience.\u201d As awareness of sexual assault on campuses across the country grows, CMC is looking to make such training a key part of its student experience.\u000aThe email continues:\u000a\u201cThese allegations are a reminder to be mindful at all times of what you are drinking and to keep an eye out for your fellow students.  While this is a small campus and we would like to trust our fellow students, accepting a drink that was made by someone else or that was put in a cup that you did not bring yourself is risky.  If you do not maintain constant visual contact with your cup, something can be slipped in it quickly and without your knowledge even if the drink started out fine.  Being vigilant about the source of your drink as well as the integrity of your cup once it is in your possession decreases the risks of anything being slipped in your drink.  Please help us keep our campuses safer.\u201d\u000aSome students were concerned that the email was an example of \u201cvictim-blaming\u201d and \u201crape culture.\u201d\u000a\u201cThis is a message from campus safety in response to multiple students being drugged on Claremont McKenna\u2019s campus. This is disgusting. This is unacceptable. This is rape culture,\u201d wrote one student in a widely-shared Facebook post. \u201cThis is textbook victim-blaming, and it is coming right from the people who are hired to protect us.\u201d\u000aOthers students argued that while the acts were obviously \u201cdeplorable\u201d, the email still served a practical purpose. Another student from Pomona College responded, \u201cI agree that it\u2019s frustrating to be told that the responsibility to be safe falls on potential victims but a) when thinking practically about how to deal with the reality of an unsafe campus, I do appreciate these reminders and b) I think that camp sec individuals would probably agree with the sentiment that people should not do things like drug other people\u2019s drinks (and to be sure, the email did include \u2013 begin with \u2013 a paragraph about how such behavior was deplorable and not to be tolerated).\u201d\u000aWhile the subject of drugs on campus presented itself at last night\u2019s ASCMC Senate meeting, few had answers. One student noted, \u201cFor most of the student body, this incident is the first encounter with reports on roofie-type drugs anywhere on the Claremont Colleges, so information is sparse.\u201d At the time of writing, no further notices from Campus Safety or Claremont Colleges Administrations have been communicated.\u000aShare this:Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)MoreClick to print (Opens in new window)Click to share on Pinterest (Opens in new window)Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)Click to share on Google+ (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Tags: Claremont Colleges Rape CultureCategories: Campus News

aS'Iowa Caucuses: What You Need to Know'
p599
aVWhat are the Iowa Caucuses?\u000aIn both parties\u2019 nomination processes, the first state to cast its votes is the state of Iowa, which does so in the form of a caucus. While New Hampshire\u2019s state constitution has a law dictating that New Hampshire must be the first state to hold a primary each election cycle, Iowa skirts this law by remaining loyal to the caucus system. The Iowa caucus rose to prominence in the media in 1972, (in large part due to the long-shot candidacy of then Governor of Georgia Jimmy Carter) and has not left the spotlight since. While most states used to use a caucus system, states including Texas, California, New York, and many others have recently opted to abandon them in favor of primaries; most caucus states are smaller (population-wise) than average. Caucuses are far more interactive than the primary system, but actually work quite differently for the Republican and Democratic parties.\u000aDuring a Democratic caucus, voters are free to discuss and debate their candidates\u2019 merits. After the allotted time period (typically 30 minutes) is up, the organizers take up a head count of the supporters for each candidate. Any candidate with less than 15% of the caucus supporting him/her is eliminated. The caucus goers whose candidate may have been eliminated are given an additional 30 minutes to reassemble themselves and choose a new candidate to support, or abstain from voting. After that time period is up, a second count of the room (or caucus location) is taken and results are recorded. The full caucus takes about an hour and a half.\u000aFor Republicans, the process is substantially simpler and more reminiscent of what the primary system normally looks like. Republican voters (you must be a registered Republican to participate in the caucus) make their way to a caucus location, which may be a church, school, or even a private home. Once there, Republican voters cast secret ballots for their choice of candidate by writing down the name of said candidate on a piece of paper, submitting it, and then leaving. This is a much quicker and more intuitive system, in total taking a maximum of around 30 minutes. Donald Trump\u2019s daughter, Ivanka, released a video explaining how to vote in the Republican caucus. Ivanka outlines the process, using the buzzwords \u201cquick\u201d, \u201ceasy\u201d, and \u201csimple\u201d no fewer than four times in the brief video. The Iowa Caucuses for Democrats and Republicans have correctly predicted the nominee in 5 of the last 7 contested (non re-elected) nominations.\u000a \u000aWhat do the Iowa Caucuses mean for the Democrats?\u000aSymbolically, the Iowa caucus is important for the Democratic party. At this time eight years ago, future President Obama was trailing Sen. Clinton by 20 points. The Iowa caucus was the first  in a string of Obama victories that would propel him to securing the nomination and presidency later that year.\u000aThe system the Democrats use will likely undermine what little support candidate Martin O\u2019Malley holds. Because the Democrat ballots in the Iowa caucus are not secret, O\u2019Malley supporters may feel pressure to support either Bernie Sanders or Hillary Clinton. This effect likely favors Clinton by a slim margin, and may swing the hotly contested Iowa caucus.\u000aIf Bernie Sanders wins Iowa, he will likely prolong the nomination process, and could even become the Democratic candidate. If Clinton cannot quickly and loudly squash the Sanders campaign, both camps face a long, drawn-out primary battle. Such a battle will both eat away at the Democrats\u2019 resources and decrease the candidates\u2019 favorability in the eyes of the voters. A Sanders victory in Iowa will cost both Sanders and Clinton a substantial amount of money as both sides levy negative campaigns against the other in the remaining 49 states and at the DNC, ultimately helping Republicans.\u000a \u000aWhat do the Iowa Caucuses mean for the Republicans?\u000aFor candidates other than Trump, Cruz, and Rubio, a strong showing in Iowa will be necessary to stay in the running. This doesn\u2019t necessarily mean the candidate has to win the popular vote in Iowa, but coming in anywhere behind the fourth place winner will seriously diminish any candidate\u2019s prospects of winning the nomination. Some of the candidates with stronger polhling in New Hampshire, including Kasich and Christie, will likely hang on to their campaigns, even with a poor showing in Iowa, but Bush (who has name recognition) and Carson (who is polling at a steady 4th in most polls) need a large turnout to maintain their candidacies.\u000aThe most notable distinguishing characteristic of the Republican caucus as opposed to a mainstream primary system is that instead of receiving a list of all the candidates and selecting one, the caucus voters are given a blank piece of paper and write down the name of the candidate they support. This helps candidates like Trump, Bush, Rubio, and Cruz\u2013who have spent more time in the headlines\u2013and hurts candidates like Fiorina, Kasich, Paul, and Santorum, who have less name recognition. For voters who are deciding who to vote for in today\u2019s caucus, the candidates with significant amounts of air time will be percolating in the minds of the swing voters, and name recognition will go a long way in bolstering these candidates\u2019 numbers.\u000aThe Iowa caucuses carry significant weight, but are not the end of the road for either party by any stretch. Whatever the results in Iowa, the primary contest for both parties will likely draw pundits\u2019 attention for many months to come.\u000aShare this:Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)MoreClick to print (Opens in new window)Click to share on Pinterest (Opens in new window)Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)Click to share on Google+ (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Tags: 2016 Bernie Bush Carson Caucus Clinton Cruz election Hillary Iowa Rubio Sanders TrumpCategories: Feature

aVLast night, the Marian Miner Cook Athenaeum at Claremont McKenna College hosted comedian Walter Kamau Bell to give a talk about ending racism. Prior to the event, Bell told the Claremont Independent, \u201cI absolutely have an agenda. It won\u2019t be hidden. And I\u2019m also married to a white woman with two mixed-race kids, so I\u2019m a bridge-builder.\u201d Additionally, Bell noted, \u201cthe best thing that ever happened to me was that a friend of mine in Oakland\u2014white woman, lesbian, black kids\u2014just to say, this is a very specific type of person. In Oakland there\u2019s a lot of those. And we were talking about my racism show. And she said, \u2018Kamau, you can\u2019t end racism and make sexism worse.\u2019\u201d\u000aBell, introduced as a \u201cSocial Justice Ambassador,\u201d stated that he plans to end racism by instructing white people to form a tighter-knit community and to take pride in their race. \u201cWhite people, you have to have some pride,\u201d said Bell. \u201cThere\u2019s gotta be reasons for white people to have good white pride. Right now, you\u2019re letting white people run rampant, and that makes the rest of us have to work harder. And that\u2019s bullshit.\u201d During his talk, Bell addressed the white audience members. \u201cWhite people, I can see your faces, the lights are on, the lights are shining. Say it loud, say, \u2018I\u2019m white and I\u2019m proud!\u2019 Here we go, white people. This is happening, this is a thing. \u2018I\u2019m white and I\u2019m proud!\u2019\u201d\u000aBell began his show by listing the words he was not going to use during the performance. \u201cWords like \u2018minority,\u2019 \u2018Caucasian,\u2019 \u2018colorblind,\u2019 \u2018people of color,\u2019 \u2018nonwhite.\u2019 Words like \u2018diversity,\u2019 words like \u2018multicultural,\u2019 \u2018multiculturalism,\u2019 \u2018multiculturalocity,\u2019\u201d [sic] the list began. \u201cWords like, \u2018Martin Luther King, Jr.\u2019 And finally, the last word you won\u2019t hear in this show is \u2018the n-word.\u2019 Oh, don\u2019t be confused\u2014you\u2019ll definitely hear the word \u2018nigger\u2019\u2014you just won\u2019t hear \u2018the n-word.\u2019 In fact, \u2018NIGGER!\u2019\u201d he shouted, displaying the word in all caps on the projector. Bell did not use this word at any other time during the performance, but he did use the word \u201cdiversity\u201d despite his initial plans not to.\u000aBell later stated that he feels sorry for college students because \u201cYou\u2019re all on Twitter, you\u2019re all on Snapchat, you\u2019re all on Instagram, and so the world finds out what happens when you\u2019re in college and colleges can\u2019t be these little tight petri dishes anymore.\u201d Though Bell stated, \u201cI feel bad for you guys. I could\u2019ve made a lot of mistakes and you never heard about it,\u201d that didn\u2019t stop him from showing a Facebook photo of a group of current students\u2019 regrettable Halloween costumes and making fun of them in front of their peers. \u201cIt\u2019s America, it\u2019s your country. Enjoy your freedom. But there are consequences. That\u2019s how free speech works,\u201d Bell stated.\u000aBell, whose performance was\u2014as promised\u2014heavy on partisan content, also shared his opinions on Donald Trump. \u201cI don\u2019t give a shit if you\u2019re not voting for him. That\u2019s your boy, and you\u2019re connected through whiteness,\u201d Bell stated. \u201cIt\u2019s not about voting, it\u2019s about stopping the speech.\u201d Bell also criticized the staff of the Claremont Independent during his show. \u201cLatinos and black people get killed by police unarmed way more than white people. That\u2019s all facts. But you\u2019re like, I don\u2019t know, I\u2019m still not convinced\u2026 I write for the Independent.\u2019\u201d\u000aWhen the Independent asked Bell about free speech from a comedian\u2019s perspective\u2014specifically, comedians such as Chris Rock and Jerry Seinfeld citing political correctness as a reason not to perform on college campuses\u2014Bell stated that oversensitivity had nothing to do with the issue. \u201cThe story was that somebody told Chris Rock that they had stopped performing at colleges,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd then Chris told Jerry Seinfeld, and Jerry Seinfeld told the media.\u201d Bell also noted, \u201cColleges are always more politically correct than real society because when you go to college you\u2019re supposed to learn new things. That\u2019s just how it works.\u201d\u000aBell said the reason he thinks these comedians don\u2019t perform at colleges is because colleges don\u2019t want them. \u201cAt some point you age out of performing at colleges. Colleges don\u2019t necessarily want to hear what a man in his sixties, like Jerry Seinfeld, or a man of Chris Rock\u2019s\u2014in his fifties\u2014thinks,\u201d the 44-year-old Bell stated. Additionally, Bell claimed, \u201cYou can\u2019t afford those guys because they\u2019re billionaires. Or millionaires, almost billionaires.\u201d\u000aChris Rock might disagree with Bell\u2019s analysis of the story. \u201cI stopped playing colleges, and the reason is because they\u2019re way too conservative,\u201d Rock stated just over a year ago. \u201cNot in their political views\u2014not like they\u2019re voting Republican\u2014but in their social views and their willingness not to offend anybody.\u201d Similarly, Jerry Seinfeld recently stated, \u201cI don\u2019t play colleges, but I hear a lot of people tell me, \u2018Don\u2019t go near colleges, they\u2019re so PC.\u2019\u201d Fortunately, Bell told the Independent that he is \u201ca big fan also of finding out that I\u2019m wrong about something and having people explain to me how I could be right about it.\u201d\u000a \u000a_______________________________\u000a \u000aImage source: Flavorwire\u000aShare this:Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)MoreClick to print (Opens in new window)Click to share on Pinterest (Opens in new window)Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)Click to share on Google+ (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Tags: Claremont McKenna College Political CorrecntessCategories: Campus News

p607
aVEarlier today, Pomona College President David Oxtoby sent out an email to the student body, faculty, and staff. The email, cosigned by Dean Crighton, Dean Feldblum, and Dean Collins-Eaglin, begins by stating, \u201cLast fall, our community \u2014 along with other colleges and universities across the country \u2014 grappled with the tough and important matters of race, racism, economic inequality, access to higher education, and how we live and thrive together as a diverse and inclusive community.\u201d The note continues by describing the value of the discussions surrounding last semester\u2019s controversies. \u201cWe had difficult conversations about these complex topics in formal and informal settings; while we did not always agree, and at times these were uncomfortable exchanges for many of us, we are convinced that they were right and necessary.\u201d\u000aThe statement then details the importance of free speech on college campuses. \u201cColleges and universities are the exact places where these discussions should unfold because one of academia\u2019s highest values is free, open, informed, and honest inquiry,\u201d the email states. \u201cAt their best, colleges support and value diversity of critical thought and experiences. When this happens, academic institutions can be powerful catalysts for both meaningful dialogue and consequential change. While beyond our gates, polarization is becoming the norm, here on campus, we have the opportunity and the duty to develop the knowledge and skills to change that trajectory and better the world around us.\u201d\u000a\u201cTo that end,\u201d the statement continues, \u201cwe write to our community today to let you know that with the opening of the spring semester, our desire is to move forward together.\u201d In order to do this, President Oxtoby plans \u201cto intentionally cultivate an inclusive, welcoming environment where every member of the community is integral to the life and discourse of the College\u201d as well as \u201censure that Pomona is a place where, while we may not all agree, we respect the right to speak, rebut, and respond.\u201d\u000aThe email also describes addition opportunities, such as \u201ccontinuing meetings with student groups; support for mentoring; faculty hiring; sponsoring guest speakers; purposeful dialogue to deepen our understanding and knowledge; training for faculty, staff, and students; and other substantial steps.\u201d Additionally, the email states, \u201cWe will build on the previous announcement of two new positions in Academic and Student Affairs to enhance student support, along with the additional support for student counseling. We will include members of the community in helping plan and implement these steps as we seek the most effective ways to bring about lasting change when and where it is needed.\u201d\u000a\u201cWe have learned, and will continue to learn, from the compelling experiences members of our community have shared,\u201d the note continues. \u201cTheir stories have affected us on a personal level and better inform our role as leaders. We are excited to work with you this semester and in the years ahead.\u201d\u000a \u000aShare this:Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)MoreClick to print (Opens in new window)Click to share on Pinterest (Opens in new window)Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)Click to share on Google+ (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Tags: Free Speech pomona college President OxtobyCategories: Campus News

aS'GWS Department: Racism Intersects with Heteronormativity'
p611
aVOn Thursday, the Deans of the Claremont Colleges forwarded a statement signed by over forty faculty members expressing support for campus protesters to the student body. \u201cAs Gender Studies, Feminist, and Sexuality Studies faculty at the Claremont Colleges, we write in support of students of color who have been at the forefront of making their desires known this fall semester to the administrations of our communities,\u201d the note begins. \u201cThe students have demonstrated success at refusing to be subjected further to difficult and unequal interactions in our classrooms, our dorms, and our student service centers, and they have taken action to change what is an unacceptable status quo at the colleges. We thank the students for bringing these issues to the surface for constructive discussion and concerted action.\u201d\u000a\u201cThe issues being raised are not new issues, and the sense of not being full and respected members of the college communities is not a new development,\u201d the professors continue. \u201cOur students have asked us as institutions to confront problems that are not limited to recent past events, and that will reoccur in the future if action is not taken this year to address them.\u201d\u000a\u201cRacisms at the Claremont Colleges are not an isolated problem,\u201d the email states. \u201cRacisms also intersect with other issues that plague the Colleges and society more broadly: sexism, heteronormativity, class inequality, among others. Recent campus reports about pervasive issues of sexual assault, incidents of harassment of queer and trans students, and ongoing financial struggles for many working class and first generation students demonstrate the ways in which students of color work across these intersections.\u201d\u000a\u201cWe stand in support of those who no longer tolerate the structural inequalities, the overt and covert forms of violence, and the complicities with racism and other intersecting problems that plague our colleges and our society,\u201d the statement continues. \u201cWe write to ask the administrative leadership at our consortium to take this opportunity to reflect seriously on the student demands, and to take action to address the issues raised by the students to ensure that the colleges move forward to reduce racism and to provide an educational environment for all students that is consonant with the complex diversity of our nation and our world.\u201d\u000aThe faculty members state, \u201cAdministrative change at this juncture may take this opportunity as an opening of possible new directions and for building an educational environment where all students can thrive and where differences produce constructive emotional, intellectual, and social experiences on campus for all.\u201d\u000aThe note closes by stating, \u201cThe students have mobilized, the faculty are mobilizing, and neither students nor faculty are going anywhere soon. So if administrative leadership does not take this opportunity to commit significant funds and other resources, time and energy, training and development to address the student concerns, then they may lose their credibility as educators. We ask you to act now to address the students\u2019 concerns.\u201d\u000aShare this:Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)MoreClick to print (Opens in new window)Click to share on Pinterest (Opens in new window)Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)Click to share on Google+ (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Tags: Black Lives Matter Gender studies Protests Women's studiesCategories: Campus News

aS'The Grinch Who Stole Culture: How We\xe2\x80\x99re Losing America\xe2\x80\x99s Melting Pot'
p615
aVOne of the things I value most about America is our unique level of diversity. Our diversity entails more than just having a large portion of non-white US residents. Rather, it relies on both the breadth of different cultures as well as the depth of the personal connections in which we can experience these different cultures. On a practical level, this mean that races, ethnicities, and religions that differ from our own are more than just concepts that we read about in books. Our melting pot in America gives us the unique and direct ability to see, and in some cases experience, other cultures instead of just reading about their eccentricities. \u000aEvery day we are surrounded by a diverse array of people and cultures and because of this, I see the United States as a palette of cultures from which we each can personally sample. What I find most valuable about this is that in some cases, we may create a color that we find more beautiful and that we love more sincerely than any one color alone. \u000aIn this process of cultural integration, it is true that some of the original culture\u2019s authenticity thins. And it is also true that there are some people that exploit integration or, in poor taste, take it too far. But this is hardly enough to even come close to canceling out the more positive aspects of this integration. Namely, that we are given the gift of being able to share parts of countless cultures in our daily lives. And because we can share in these cultures as a routine and not just a once-in-a-decade trip to a foreign country, we are able to internalize cultures that differ from our own constantly and on a much more profound level. \u000aMany of the students upset about cultural appropriation at CMC suggest that the only way to solve the problem of racism and misappropriation is through intense discussion. These students are fixated on the minute realities of every possible sect of every race and every culture. I would argue that practically speaking, this is not the most effective solution for several reasons. \u000aFirst, it is a privileged solution in the sense that it assumes everyone has the time and capacity to engage in an endless number of discussions. That is simply not the case. Second, tolerance is something that must be nurtured, and forcing people to sit through lengthy dialogues that are only one-sided may actually leave them with a distaste for diversity. Furthermore, if these dialogues are channeled in a way that is overly detailed, students will leave with a sense of confusion and with no real personal connection or love of the cultures surrounding them. What I have witnessed are methods of politicized discussions and angry protests to promote cultural sensitivity, but these methods depend on always creating a new attacker or oppressor who is worthy of being shunned.  All this does is create fragmentation. \u000aIn the process of fragmentation, groups turn away any potential outsiders. In the height of protest, for example, student activists rejected and laughed at the CMC administration for pledging to do its best to heed the students\u2019 requests and accused President Hiram Chodosh for trying to \u201cderail\u201d the movement by sending an email of support right before the protest. Student activists also created a students of color-only Motley event, and they even went so far as to say that white students hadn\u2019t done anything to help promote diversity and tolerance on our campuses.\u000aHowever, what is equally disturbing is that in addition to turning away alleged outsiders, student activists have also turned away members of their own \u201cmarginalized\u201d groups who didn\u2019t wholeheartedly agree with the movement\u2019s opinion. In a dialogue that took place on the CMCers of Color Action toward Dean of Students Facebook page, a student of Latino descent from Cornell University expressed the opinion that he did not find the CMC students\u2019 Mexican costumes problematic. He was soon scolded for participating in a conversation that he could not understand since he was not present at the 5Cs. \u000aInterestingly, an earlier Facebook post for this event featured screenshots of messages from students from other countries which were meant to show that CMC protesters were gaining international support. This was, of course, met with pride as it was seen as a symbol of validation. The hypocrisy is evident.  If a Latino student from the United States was excommunicated for being incapable of understanding the campus-specific struggles of the group, why would people who are not of Latino descent and not from this country have any greater ability to understand and support this group?\u000aWe are not fighting for the support of a marginalized group, but rather for a political ideal that attempts to expand the traditional definitions of racism and oppression. The fact that certain members of the group disagree with one another does not mean that the expansion itself is incorrect, but attempting to silence dissent should not be viewed as a means of achieving tolerance. It is creating a fragmentation that is contrary to the value of experiencing our American melting pot, and it will ultimately divide us not just between groups, but within groups as well.\u000a___________\u000aImage: Flickr\u000aShare this:Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)MoreClick to print (Opens in new window)Click to share on Pinterest (Opens in new window)Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)Click to share on Google+ (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Tags: Claremont Colleges Cultural Appropration diversity Melting Pot Protests ToleranceCategories: Opinion

aS'Only Some May Be Heard'
p619
aV\u201cWe need to be less afraid of being called racists, classists, and ableists, and more afraid of actually being those things,\u201d lamented one student at Scripps College\u2019s BeHeard Forum. The subject we had gathered to discuss was Silencing and Tone Policing \u2013 two phrases I had never heard until the week prior, when several Facebook comment wars exploded over supposed racialized and transphobic event titles, descriptions, and surveys. People\u2019s actions and intentions soon became irrelevant because only language, and those who got to wield it, mattered.\u000aSuch encounters do not come as a surprise. We live in a time when extreme political correctness and campus movements \u2013 started mostly by minority students in an effort to silence any speech that they find hurtful or offensive \u2013 are raging across the country. The BeHeard Forum, intended to be a forum for resolving differences, quickly became an opportunity for people identifying as \u201cvictims\u201d to complain about their pain and suffering while stifling constructive discourse concerning what constitutes appropriate campus debate. The forum highlighted the desire of some campus groups to ensure that those individuals with whom they disagree not be heard at all.\u000aThis particular forum was held in response to a Scripps Voice poll. The writer asked, \u201cAre you aware of any Scripps stereotypes? Do they affect you?\u201d The stereotypes in question essentially boil down to \u201cpromiscuous student\u201d or \u201cearnest feminist.\u201d Somehow, this too became an issue of race when students began questioning if \u201cfitting in\u201d to a Scripps stereotype meant belonging to a certain race.\u000aAnd then there was the outrage over a feminist event which served cupcakes decorated with vulvas, at which a former employee of the Queer Resource Center became incensed, stating, \u201cHow dare you associate vulvas with being a woman. I feel so violated.\u201d Despite apologies from the event organizer, the conversation devolved into accusations of insensitivity towards trans women.\u000aTone policing is defined as the process in which a white or otherwise \u201cprivileged\u201d person focuses on how something is being said, particularly when it is driven by anger or other heightened emotions. Silencing is when a member of a \u201cvictim class\u201d does not feel safe enough to speak because another person \u2013 typically an authority figure or a white classmate \u2013 imposes a status or set of assumptions which the victim does not share. For example, if a straight person casually asks a classmate, \u201cAre you interested in any guys?\u201d the speaker has made an assumption about someone\u2019s sexual identity that may or may not be accurate. This assumption, victims argue, silences the other person, even though the bisexual or lesbian classmate could just say something like \u201cI\u2019m interested in girls\u201d to clear up any confusion.

p627
aVThe Claremont Colleges, like nearly every other liberal arts college in America, are a bastion of liberal and progressive thought. You don\u2019t have to read our other articles to realize this; the Claremont College Democrats outnumber the Claremont College Republicans nearly five to one (according to their Facebook page subscribers), with the lion\u2019s share of Republicans attending CMC.\u000aThis political imbalance is understandable to an extent; young voters favored President Obama in the 2012 elections more than any other age demographic. Compared to the rest of the country, however, the Claremont Colleges are lopsidedly liberal, a reality on display when students this semester packed Pitzer\u2019s Benson Auditorium to see Martin O\u2019Malley speak, leaving standing room only. The majority of tenured faculty at the Claremont Colleges are Democrats.\u000aNevertheless, the problem is not necessarily the excessive Democratic numbers. Liberal, even progressive thought, is not inherently opposed to free speech. Rather, the problem is the silencing of opposing viewpoints. Students with pro-life or capitalist views get shot down without being heard, branded \u201cracist, misogynist, and bigoted\u201d for disagreeing with the mainstream Claremont consensus. In the aftermath of the recent protests, friendships have been destroyed and reputations have been ruined. In the discussion on campus racism, it becomes clear that we, as college students, don\u2019t want friends. We want sounding boards and echo chambers.\u000aThe intense backlash from overly politically correct culture has gone from present to dangerous. Here in Claremont, students verbally attacked their peers for not joining in on a protest march against the CMC administration, screaming \u201csilence is violence.\u201d We\u2019re no longer allowed to recuse ourselves from the discussion if we disagree; we\u2019re expected to strongly agree with the PC movement. In a world where \u201cIf you don\u2019t have something nice to say, don\u2019t say anything at all\u201d is no longer accepted, the PC movement not only polices your words and actions, but also your thoughts. Perhaps President Obama said it best:\u000a\u201cI\u2019ve heard some college campuses where they don\u2019t want to have a guest speaker who is too conservative or they don\u2019t want to read a book if it has language that is offensive to African-Americans or somehow sends a demeaning signal towards women. I gotta tell you, I don\u2019t agree with that either. I don\u2019t agree that you, when you become students at colleges, have to be coddled and protected from different points of view. I think you should be able to \u2014 anybody who comes to speak to you and you disagree with, you should have an argument with \u2018em. But you shouldn\u2019t silence them by saying, \u2018You can\u2019t come because I\u2019m too sensitive to hear what you have to say.\u2019 That\u2019s not the way we learn either.\u201d\u000aPresident Obama is right. Silence does not educate. The way to convince people whom you disagree with is to engage and debate with their ideas. The PC craze silences the discussion before it even starts. Because the discussion ends prematurely, the \u201coffensive\u201d party never has their opinions changed. They merely learn that their views could be considered racist, sexist, or homophobic. Even if the end goal is progressive thought, silencing the discussion cannot convince someone that their views need to be changed.\u000aUnfortunately, the PC craze has implanted itself firmly in the consciousness of the Claremont Colleges. The recent campus protests are far from the first sightings of political correctness run amok in Claremont. Refusing to engage an entity in discussion, however, does not change anyone\u2019s opinions. Though I\u2019m not about to defend George Will\u2019s remarks, Will and other silenced voices are, if anything, more stubbornly convinced of their opinions. There\u2019s no room to expand students\u2019 horizons by listening to other views, considering the arguments, and agreeing to disagree with peers. In PC culture, if two people don\u2019t agree on a hot-button issue, we are taught not to separate the idea from the person but to link the two inextricably.\u000aI don\u2019t want to equate the PC craze with left-wing thought, especially in light of President Obama\u2019s remarks. Classical liberalism, in its purest form, advocates for universal liberty. The Democratic Party, unlike the Republican Party, yields significant support for legalizing marijuana and abolishing the death penalty. The Republican Party can be just as guilty of silencing minority voices as the Democratic Party.\u000aI remember, as a junior high school student, my pastor would invite a resident political enthusiast up to the microphone. The speaker would talk about the upcoming election, throw in a line about how she had prayed about each and every proposition and had \u201claid hands on her ballot\u201d and told us how she felt God was leading her to vote. The speaker would instruct each member of the congregation which propositions to vote yes and no. We received brochures with the church\u2019s logo stamped in the corner with a voting guide for the propositions and candidates. The dialogue carried over into the parking lot, and people who didn\u2019t agree with the church\u2019s narrative were looked down on. The right wing can also be guilty of subduing discussion by imposing its own narrative and agenda on people. Nevertheless, in light of recent events (particularly at the Claremont Colleges), the right wing is far less culpable of silencing discussion than the left.\u000aColleges ought not to shy away from discussions surrounding race, sexuality, and gender. In order to have a healthy discussion about tough, sensitive issues, we need mutual respect between the parties. Calling someone a communist, a racist, a homophobe, a flaming liberal, or any other slur ties the person to their ideas and fosters feelings of bitterness between both parties. Currently, when a student engulfed in PC culture encounters someone whom they disagree with, the response is to either convince them that their opinion is wrong or reject them from friend circles. The third, more reasonable, option of remaining friends with that person and simply agreeing to disagree is completely foreign. If we are willing to reacquaint ourselves with people who hold views that we don\u2019t agree with, we keep an open mind to considering the prospect of being wrong. A friend once told me \u201cIf you don\u2019t change at least one belief in college, you\u2019re doing it wrong.\u201d\u000a_________________________________________\u000aImage Source: Wikimedia Commons\u000aShare this:Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)MoreClick to print (Opens in new window)Click to share on Pinterest (Opens in new window)Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)Click to share on Google+ (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Tags: Daniel Ludlam Disagree diversity Opinion Political CorrectnessCategories: Opinion

aVIt\u2019s likely that every single person at CMC would claim to be pro-diversity, yet it is remarkably difficult to find someone who means it. In fact, our greatest self-proclaimed advocates for diversity seem opposed to actual diversity in any form. \u000a At a basic level all diversity of human beings \u2013 be it on the basis of race, gender, sexuality, or something else entirely \u2013 is heterogeneity of thought. It\u2019s generally accepted that race and ethnicity are social constructs. If we accept this premise, then racial and ethnic diversity boils down to a different experience of life as determined by the mechanisms of cultures and subcultures. The same is true for any trait tied to social status: gender, sexuality, social awkwardness, hair-color, foot-size, etc. That diversity of perspective manifests itself in a diversity of thought. Someone who has been evicted in the name of eminent domain will consider highway construction differently than a trucker who will think differently than a government official and so on and so forth. So it is logically necessary to advocate for diversity of thought if one is to advocate for diversity of race, gender, sexuality, etc. If you are an advocate for diversity of thought, then you must advocate for the idea of different thoughts slamming together. \u000a Instead, our campuses\u2019 advocates of \u201cdiversity\u201d want the opposite. These last several weeks the 5Cs have been hit by a series of calls for less diversity of thought in the name of diversity itself. My campus, CMC, in particular fell under fire for being \u201cunsafe\u201d for students of color, queer students, and other \u201cunderprivileged\u201d groups. I would argue that the \u201cdanger\u201d the protestors cited is an inevitable consequence of multiculturalism. This is in no way meant to deny that the incidents cited were not painful, but simply that they a necessary byproduct of diversity. In fact, the solutions they proposed would amount to creating segregated spaces and programs of indoctrination, effectively reducing, if not eradicating, diversity. \u000a Most students would, at this point, object to my argument. They are likely to say that \u201cdiversity\u201d initiatives are not in fact about diversity, but rather a sort of cultural victory. The reasoning would follow like this: certain groups have been marginalized and oppressed in the past (and present) and the way to make amends is to ensure members of those groups end up (in this case) in higher education. To put it bluntly: it does not matter if they mix and interact, just that everyone gets a degree. This is a strange argument in many ways. Oddest of all, it rests on the assumption that if one member of a social group receives something that somehow benefits the whole group. Underneath that lies the premise that these social constructs like race have manifested themselves in a collective well-being.\u000a This argument vastly oversimplifies social structure. Individuals are affected by unique intersections of different cultural forces. Being a black man from Detroit is different from being a black man in San Francisco. While it is conceivable that a black man in Detroit might benefit through a black man from San Francisco attending CMC, it is just as reasonable that he could benefit from a white man attending CMC. The black San Franciscan could serve as a role model to the black Michigander, but if the white man was from Detroit (i.e. if they had a shared cultural identity), he could be a role model too. When we look at the black Michigander\u2019s quality of life more broadly, the claim seems even more suspect. If the white Michigander returned to Detroit, wealthier than when he left, he could very well pour much needed wealth into the economy by employing the black Michigander. To say that this would do him less good than seeing a random black man from San Francisco become successful seems unreasonable to my mind. At the very least, it complicates matters significantly. So I would argue that the variables affecting cultural status are too complex for us to conclude that surface level diversity is valuable in and of itself. \u000a Moreover, nowhere in their demands did the protestors actually call for a more diverse student body. They would have some grounds to do so. Like most institutions of higher education, CMC is distinctly lacking in lower income students. Tuition is very high and the cost of educating students is even higher. That makes it difficult to draw in a diverse student body. Minorities are disproportionally affected by income inequality. Instead of citing this and arguing that CMC should make an effort to increase financial aid packages, the protestors called for increased operational costs. Now, you could make the argument that the spending would make CMC more attractive to the underprivileged. The problem is that not receiving enough financial aid makes it nearly impossible for an underprivileged student attend CMC. That\u2019s just it for them. Feeling uncomfortable at CMC is a softer barrier to entry. Even if it should be addressed, it would not be possible to do so from an institutional level without destroying diversity altogether. \u000a Whether in a sectioned-off resource center or across the whole of campus, it is impossible to construct a \u201csafe space\u201d unless you eradicate all meaningful diversity. People \u2013 even of the same race, gender, sexual orientation, etc. \u2013 are unique and have their own unique experiences that shape their worldview. Because they are limited in this capacity, people are often insensitive towards one another. This is unfortunate and when individual instances surface, they should be addressed. However, it is an inevitable byproduct of diversity. This is why loving, thriving married couples generally argue fairly often. If you are to partner with another person, to understand and care for them, you have to candidly discuss how you both feel and what you both think. Couples in healthy marriages know how to do so kindly and maturely, but they still do it. Still, neither member is \u201csafe.\u201d The only way to keep an individual \u201csafe\u201d in this manner is to essentially annihilate the root of the insensitivity: diversity. Driving out or silencing those with different cultural experiences is a good place to start, but if you want real homogeny, you have to go deeper and strangle any diversity of thought. \u000a Be it mandatory sensitivity trainings or general education requirements, indoctrination accomplishes this goal in the short term. Now, the proposed programs are nowhere near as Orwellian as Scripps students\u2019 demand for required anti-oppression training to brainwash its student body, but protestors want CMC to become more like Scripps in this regard. They want to institutionalize this social pressure; they want the power to bully students and faculty into agreeing. As someone who attended Scripps College, I can report that this indoctrination does often succeed in ending discussions before they begin and creating a mindless space in which students are generally too afraid to question the views their institution has handed them. The general education requirements make your GPA dependent on submission to their world view. This was my experience in CORE I, where my teacher would cut off questions or comments that were contrary to a particular brand of progressive thought and would grade down assignments that did not match her ideology. You simply agreed for the sake of the assignment, but the class built in the habit of silence and capitulation. \u000aFortunately, for those like myself who actually desire diversity, CMC has a long stood out as an institution dedicated to individualism. Approximately 30% of CMC students are conservatives. In the range of American campuses, this makes CMC one of the most conservative colleges, which gives you a sense of just how little diversity of thought exists in higher education. Moreover, CMC is actively working to bring in a more diverse student body. Announced last year by President Hiram Chodosh, the Student Imperative is an unprecedented program that adds $100 million to the endowment in order to \u201ccreate more need-based and merit-based awards in support of our Admission Officers as they push into new neighborhoods, locales, and schools \u2013 suburban, urban, rural \u2013 in search of those young brilliant minds who just need a chance.\u201d \u000aCMC has nearly reached its goal and, given its rapid success, is preparing to reach $200 million. Such a move would bring in real, meaningful diversity to the campus, rather than a pseudo-diversity agenda pushed onto the CMC administration by the recent protests.\u000a____________\u000aImage Source: Flickr\u000aShare this:Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)MoreClick to print (Opens in new window)Click to share on Pinterest (Opens in new window)Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)Click to share on Google+ (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Tags: Claremont McKenna College Core I diversity Hiram Chodosh Protests Student ImperativeCategories: Opinion

aS'Scripps Students Demand Required Anti-Oppression Training \xe2\x80\x9cTo Ensure their Unlearning Process is Continuous\xe2\x80\x9d'
p635
aVYesterday, students from Scripps College issued a list of demands to the school administration. \u201cAs a collective of students who recognize movements here, and globally, we are calling upon increased action to combat institutional racism and oppression,\u201d the students write. \u201cTogether, we have written the following list of proposed actions with the faith that our institution, Scripps College, will honor its commitment to institutional change that centers diversity and inclusivity.\u201d\u000a\u201cWe Demand: The appointment of a Vice President of Institutional Diversity who will supervise and assess the diversity and inclusion efforts in all Staff, Faculty, Administration, and Student realms of the college,\u201d the list begins. \u201cWe demand that students are able to help shape what this position will include, as well as be voting members on the hiring committee. We demand that the Board of Trustees Ad Hoc Committee on Diversity and Inclusion become a standing committee.\u201d The students feel that the creation of this position \u201cis one of the first steps in establishing an institution of checks and balances and accountability for the college on issues of diversity and inclusion.\u201d\u000aThe students also demand that the Sustained Dialogues Initiative end. \u201cSustained Dialogue Campus Network methods solely depend on utilizing marginalized student experience to catalyze discussions even at the risk of retraumatizing minority participants,\u201d they write. \u201cIn addition to this, in trainings focused on gaining facilitation skills, all participants are certified as discussion facilitators despite having openly proven themselves to be complicit in racism, classism, ableism and other modes of oppression. This indiscriminate certification process is just one example of the ways that Sustained Dialogues fails to protect, support, and center students of color.\u201d\u000aFurther, the list calls for \u201cmandatory Anti-Oppression Trainings\u201d for faculty, staff, and students. The students propose that their classmates should not be able to register for classes each semester unless they attend anti-oppression training \u201cto ensure their unlearning process is continuous.\u201d\u000a\u201cFrameworks of the occasional, optional trainings offered to faculty, administration, staff and students to promote inclusion are not focused on explicitly naming and addressing facets of oppression and the intersections between them (including, but not limited to: racism, classism, ableism, homophobia etc),\u201d the students state. \u201cScripps has a history of using its seemingly \u2018progressive and paradisiacal\u2019 nature to avoid addressing, naming, and putting systems in place so that our community can begin to explicitly unlearn the ways in which we are complicit in structural and interpersonal violence.\u201d\u000aAdditionally, the list of demands includes a request for modifications to Scripps\u2019 CORE curriculum. \u201cCORE 1 has continually failed to aptly educate Scripps students on the topics of Race, Ethnicity, and Gender,\u201d the students write. \u201cStudents should be learning about modern manifestations of systemic violence including but not limited to: gentrification, police brutality, military industrial complex, xenophobia, immigration, prison industrial complex, food deserts, and sexual assault on college campuses.\u201d\u000aThe students also demand \u201cthe hiring of an on-campus therapist experienced in healing and processing racial based trauma,\u201d as well as \u201cA policy of accommodations for students that experience racial-based trauma, equal to accommodations given to disabled students.\u201d\u000a\u201cRacially traumatized students are put in unsafe spaces,\u201d the students write. \u201cInstitutional racialized violence creates no room for students to have healing time for their race-based trauma. These students are forced to encounter the same perpetrators and discriminators\u2014who may be fellow peers, faculty, and administration\u2014thus retraumatizing these students as they are in hostile environments (ie. residential halls, classrooms, dining commons).\u201d\u000aThe list also calls for \u201cthe removal of SAT/ACT/Standardized Testing from the admissions process\u201d because \u201cSATs/ACTs are strongly biased against low-income students and students of color, at a time when diversity is critical to our mission statement and campus climate.\u201d The students state, \u201cRemoving the SAT/ACT requirement for admission makes Scripps more accessible to populations who would otherwise be isolated from applying.\u201d\u000aIn addition, the students demand \u201cThe establishment of an intercollegiate department for Indigenous Studies and Disability Studies, respectively.\u201d The students note, \u201cCourse curriculum that reflects diverse lived experiences is important in boosting retention rates and creating individuals with inclusive excellence.\u201d\u000aThe students also call for \u201cincreased scholarship and support\u201d for illegal immigrants due to the fact that \u201cCalifornia has one of the largest undocumented populations and Scripps should be responsive to the demands in the immediate geographical community by supporting undocumented/DACAmented students pursuing higher education.\u201d\u000a\u201cEvery other college in the consortium has at least one undocumented/DACAmented student and have explicit policies for admitting undocumented/DACAmented students,\u201d the students write. \u201cScripps should follow suit and implement an official policy to ensure that undocumented/DACAmented students are able to attend and succeed at Scripps to resist subjugation for people who cannot obtain legal citizenship.\u201d\u000aThe list of demands closes with a call for the abolishment of the 7C Demonstration policy. \u201cWe Demand: A repeal of the 7C Demonstration policy in all of its forms and a statement that acknowledges the institutional violence of endorsing the policy at all,\u201d the students write. \u201cDemonstrations are by nature disruptive, so these policies discourage students from protesting at all with the threat of both police force and academic consequences. When considering which students are more likely to protest or need to protest, these policies disproportionately target students of color and marginalized students.\u201d\u000aScripps Associated Students (SAS) will hold an open forum to discuss these demands at the Motley on December 1.\u000aShare this:Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)MoreClick to print (Opens in new window)Click to share on Pinterest (Opens in new window)Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)Click to share on Google+ (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Tags: Demands Protest Scripps College steven glickCategories: Campus News

aS'Monsanto Speaker: Claremont is \xe2\x80\x9cBy Far the Worst Student Audience\xe2\x80\x9d Ever Encountered'
p639
aVAfter students heavily protested her lecture at Harvey Mudd College last night, Dr. Chrissy Lawrence of Monsanto Company, an agricultural biotechnology corporation, canceled the lecture she was slated to give at the Keck Science Center. \u201cI don\u2019t know how many of you attended last night\u2019s talk from a Monsanto scientist, but some of the students behaved unprofessionally,\u201d noted a Harvey Mudd College professor in an email obtained by the Claremont Independent. \u201cThe Monsanto speaker said that in all her years of presenting to students in colleges/universities that last night\u2019s student audience was by far the worst student audience she had ever encountered.\u201d\u000aMuch of the backlash against the Monsanto representative came from Pitzer College students. In an open letter published in The Student Life, Adin Bonapart (PZ \u201916) criticized the decision to allow Dr. Lawrence a platform to speak since she is associated with \u201cprivate interests from monopolistic corporations.\u201d\u000a\u201cBecause of the controversial nature of this topic, I urge you to postpone Dr. Lawrence\u2019s visit and invite her to return as a panelist alongside knowledgeable academics and a more diverse set of voices, or revoke her invitation completely,\u201d Bonapart writes. \u201cAs the most-hated corporation on earth, Monsanto and its subsidiaries should NOT be freely allowed to promote themselves at our academic institutions.\u201d\u000a\u201cMonsanto\u2019s products and policies are unsafe, unjust, unsustainable, violent and undemocratic,\u201d Bonapart continues. \u201cIt would be a great shame to myself and to many of my peers if Dr. Lawrence was allowed to speak on campus.\u201d\u000aSeveral other Pitzer students expressed similar concerns regarding Dr. Lawrence\u2019s lecture in a Student Talk email thread. \u201cMonsanto\u2019s legacy on land and people all over the world has been horrific,\u201d notes one student. \u201cI do not flinch when arguing that they have, and are still, involved in committing mass genocide onto our entire biosphere.\u201d\u000aIn the same email thread, another Pitzer student stated, \u201cThis is not a matter of refusing to listen to the other side. It is about standing up for human and land rights\u2026 and holding our colleges accountable for doing the same.\u201d\u000a\u201cMonsanto, who not only creates their own research, but has proprietary rights over it, has unmitigated discretion over what studies get, and don\u2019t get published,\u201d the student continues. \u201cNot only this, but the company has been known to silence other research that doesn\u2019t fit their agenda!\u201d\u000aThe student closes by stating, \u201cI understand the importance of listening to, and grappling with differing points of view. This type of dialogue creates important critical thought, as well as individuals whose values are better equipped and informed. I will argue however, that Monsanto has too much disproportionate power: this conversation will not be equal, or truthful. To welcome them to our campus is an expression that we welcome and approve of crimes they have, and continue to commit.\u201d\u000aA physics professor from the Keck Science Department responded to this student by pointing out that, \u201cThere\u2019s unfortunately a lot of misinformation floating around about Monsanto and GMOs in general. Specifically, the highlighted quote from the final article in [name redacted]\u2019s first email is from 2009 and out of date. Articles further investigating that issue show that Monsanto does not have any veto power over independent research at US universities.\u201d\u000a\u201cThe current situation is not perfect, but it\u2019s not nearly as bad as that Scientific American article made it out to be,\u201d the professor continues. \u201cAnd it\u2019s certainly not the case that Monsanto has \u2018unmitigated discretion\u2019 over what research gets published.\u201d\u000aIn place of Dr. Lawrence\u2019s lecture, the Keck Science Department will host an open discussion tomorrow focusing on exchanging ideas on college campuses.\u000a______________\u000aImage: Flickr\u000aShare this:Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)MoreClick to print (Opens in new window)Click to share on Pinterest (Opens in new window)Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)Click to share on Google+ (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Categories: Campus News

aS'President Oxtoby Signs Off on Student Demands at Pomona College'
p643
aVLast night, Pomona College President David Oxtoby signed off on a long list of student demands. \u201cWe, a group of marginalized students who have not been served by Pomona College, demand that President Oxtoby support and implement the following,\u201d states the document.\u000a\u201cWe demand that Pomona College\u2019s President, David Oxtoby, invoke his power and leadership at the Claremont Colleges by releasing a public statement of support and solidarity for \u2018CMCers of Color,\u2019\u201d the document begins. \u201cPomona College, as an institution, should acknowledge the validity of their demands for institutional change, which include but are not limited to: a permanent Resource Center by Spring 2016, student representation in hiring the next CMC Dean of Students, and hiring a CMC Diversity and Inclusivity Chair.\u201d\u000a\u201cThis formal commitment and statement must explicitly use language that will directly acknowledges [sic] the inequities that exist within these institutions and that legitimizes the experiences of marginalized communities by recognizing the different systemic factors that contribute to their oppression. Explicitly, this means that the terms \u2018marginalization,\u2019 \u2018institutional racism,\u2019 \u2018failure to support,\u2019 and \u2018violence\u2019 should be present in this statement.\u201d\u000aAdditionally, the student protestors requested that President Oxtoby hold separate meetings for various student groups. \u201cWe demand that each affinity group has a personal meeting with President Oxtoby to discuss our individual, unique needs and struggles for the creation or improvement of cultural spaces,\u201d the students write. \u201cThese meetings will begin this Friday, November 20, 2015, and will be weekly with a different affinity group.\u201d\u000aThese affinity groups are defined as:

aS'Safe Spaces Segregate the Claremont Colleges'
p647
aVIn the wake of last week\u2019s protests and resignations at Claremont McKenna College (CMC), \u201csafe spaces\u201d for students of marginalized identities are popping up all over the campuses of the Claremont Colleges. After protestors called for action, CMC President Hiram Chodosh stated his commitment to providing a permanent safe space for students of color in the near future. Until then, the Associated Students of Claremont McKenna College (ASCMC) have dedicated part of their office as a safe space for these students.\u000aSafe spaces for minority students have appeared on the campuses of other Claremont Colleges as well. Last week, the Motley Coffeehouse at Scripps College issued a statement on its official Facebook page, \u201cThe Motley sitting room will be open tonight from 6-10 only for people of color and allies that they invite. Please feel free to come and use the space for whatever you need \u2013 decompress, discuss, grieve, plan, support each other, etc. In solidarity.\u201d

aS'Silence isn\xe2\x80\x99t Violence. Terrorism is.'
p651
aVIn light of everything that has happened these last few days, it is time for us to take a moment to remember just how lucky we are to live in this country and attend the Claremont Colleges. Through all of the fighting, animosity, and inflammatory rhetoric, we who attend these schools still have the luxury of feeling safe as we crawl into bed at night. We have the luxury of not having to worry that our friends, parents, or loved ones will be the victims of barbarity\u2013\u2013a privilege that many in this world are not accorded.\u000aMultiple acts of terrorism took place in the last few days: in Paris, Baghdad, and Beirut. The Beirut attack in particular has drawn the attention of many; it occurred the day before the Paris bombings, was largely ignored by the Western media, and likely would have been forgotten had Paris not suffered a similar tragedy. I have heard rumblings and seen posts on social media concerning this seemingly callous oversight, interspersed with questions as to why the sufferings of Paris eclipse those of Beirut. The answer is quite simple; an attack on a Western city like Paris is a rarity, while the attack in Beirut is a common, almost daily occurrence. Events that are this common are not striking or newsworthy, especially in today\u2019s 24 hour news cycle. They happen so often that we simply consider them the norm.\u000aSo with all of the troubles and inconveniences that we students have propounded in the previous week, try and let the brutal attack on Beirut sink in. Let it sink in that there are places on this Earth where death and destruction are so common as to warrant only a cursory mention by the media and virtually no mention by us students. Places where a parent burying their child is deemed a mere commonality. Places where there are no safe spaces, no free speech, and no support for people with \u201cmarginalized identities.\u201d Cast in this light, what are our troubles but petty differences and trivialities? Can we not take a hard look at the inhumanity occurring around the world, decide to set aside our differences, and be bigger than our problems? \u000a5C students, realize that evil does not sit next to you in a classroom. It does not eat in the same dining hall as you, sleep in the same dorm as you, or go to the same classes as you. Evil is not your fellow students. The attacks in Beirut, Paris, and Baghdad are evil. And it is against those atrocities that we should be protesting, against those savage acts that we should be fighting. We should not quarrel amongst ourselves because of foolish differences; we must recognize that there are problems in this world bigger than ourselves, bigger than our schools. Do not continue to fight and divide on the basis of race or creed, such things are insignificant compared to the suffering all around us. Every student, myself included, should realize that we all have privilege, we all have luxuries and\u2013\u2013most of all\u2013\u2013we are lucky to be students at the Claremont Colleges. \u000a_________________\u000aImage: Wiki Commons\u000aShare this:Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)MoreClick to print (Opens in new window)Click to share on Pinterest (Opens in new window)Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)Click to share on Google+ (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Categories: Opinion

aS'277 Students Dissent and Ask For Reconciliation'
p655
aVNathan Tsai (CMC \u201917) wrote a campus-wide letter, which was sent out this afternoon. The letter was sent out with 236 anonymous CMC student signatures, and it has since reached 277 signatures. The content of the letter has been reprinted here, and it has not been modified or altered for publication.\u000a___________________\u000aFellow Students, Faculty, Staff, Alumni, and CMC Community,\u000aUndoubtedly, the events of the past week have resulted in much pain, anger, and sadness. It is now more important than ever for us to remain a community and family. However, before we begin the reconciliation process, it is our obligation as students, and citizens of this college, to speak our minds free of any fear of retaliation. With the utmost amount of respect for the movement, we ask that you hear us out so that we may begin to resolve the issues that have consumed our campus and the nation.\u000aTo preface our opinions we would like to state that discrimination is not an aspect of society that we will ever endorse. No matter what form of prejudice exists, we acknowledge that such behavior is harmful to both the victims of it and those around them. We reiterate that such acts of bias and intolerance will be met with the same amount of tenacity that compels you to your activism, and we shall channel that strength to more effective and productive means of resolution. We acknowledge that marginalization is a problem throughout the entire nation, and regardless of the color of our skin we promise to continue to change the status quo until people of all backgrounds and dispositions can live together without any fear of racial intolerance.\u000aThat being said, we do not condone many of the actions of the movement this past week. We have tried our very best to listen, and stand with you. In spite of the patience we have shown, we can no longer be silent. Members of the CMC community will always stand by one another, and we have done so, but it is now time to share how we feel.\u000aKeep in mind that we are not your opposition, we do not fight against what you are trying to accomplish, nor do we seek to discredit you. Rather, we are another voice, different as it may be from yours. We cannot be silent any longer for this is now an issue that has an impact on all of us. It is of utmost importance that we begin to openly share with each other how we feel so that all voices have the opportunity to be heard.\u000aThe following grievances listed are those that the signers of this letter reprimand:\u000aI.            Halloween: While we do not condone the costumes and cultural insensitivity that the girls in costumes displayed, it is not permissible to publicly humiliate and essentially cyber bully girls that have repeatedly apologized. We are young and we make mistakes. Though that does not excuse actions, it warrants forgiveness and understanding that we learn from our mistakes. This letter serves as a petition and a request for you to remove your photos of those girls online. They are already in the news, and were on live television for multiple nights in a row. It is time that you see this from peer to peer. These girls made mistakes, they do not deserve to publicly shamed for the rest of their lives.\u000aII.            A student has opened a federal investigation of Claremont McKenna College. The investigator, Mr. Howard has made it very clear that the consequences are severe whether or not CMC is found guilty. We have already written to Mr. Howard and it is now up to you to decide what course of action to take. We realize that you have a right to do so, and ask that you reflect if CMC\u2019s offenses are so great that you would ask for an audit of every and all programs and resources on campus that could take years. Unlike the movement, we do not publicly ostracize the student responsible, but instead ask you to reconsider what you\u2019re doing for the future of CMC. The future of the incoming class of 2020, and the generations of CMCers to come relies on whether or not you decide to pursue the investigation by the Department of Education, that may indeed cripple CMC. Please, please rethink your actions and ask yourself if you have that much hatred for this school, that you would knowingly soon depart and leave this mess in the hands of those students who inherit it from you. This is not the route to take for resolutions of the issues on campus, and doing so will simply divide CMC further.\u000aIII.            Regardless of how you interpreted the former Dean\u2019s email, it was extremely inappropriate to hunger strike for Mary Spellman\u2019s resignation. A hunger strike implies that you are willing to die for the cause you strike for. Were Mary Spellman\u2019s offenses so great that you would die for her resignation? You ask what the alternative is? It sits in front of you, a petition, a civil and democratic tool. Instead you accuse the Dean of not caring about your health and not listening to you when you chose to starve yourself. If we were to starve ourselves unless you left this campus, how would you feel? The most effective form of government reform comes from petition by the people, not drastic measures by the few. Mary Spellman is a person, a human being, and you put her in a situation where the Dean had to decide to sacrifice her whole career or let you starve. No matter what you think of her, as an administrator of this campus she would do anything to ensure your health and well-being. Your claims of democratic principles through assembly are invalidated by the savagery of your actions. According to sources in the faculty, Dean Spellman was not pressured to resign, nor were members of the administration expecting her to. She resigned of her own accord, showing that she does indeed care about you. Reflect on what you forced her to do as human beings with feelings and emotions. In 2 days you destroyed a career that a woman has worked for years to build, and you have removed a resource from campus that many marginalized students were using as theirs. We pray that someday when you are all in positions of power, and you will be because you are CMCers, that acts such as these will never force your hand and make you feel the way you made Mary Spellman feel.\u000aIV.            There is not a single college president in the United States, and perhaps even the world, that will not only allow you to call him by his first name, but also allow you to berate and yell at him for more than 3 hours. While you accused him of taking too long to respond, and belittled him for speaking through a microphone, you began to lose the legitimacy the movement had, and the humanity that you had. Did Hiram not open his doors for office hours the night before? Did he not open his ears to listen to all that you had to say? For someone who has listened to so many voices, so many stories, and so many profanities, is it not warranted for him to have a pause before his response? This is not a Presidential debate where an answer is prepared for every possible question. This was an open forum with the opportunity to have constructive criticisms and productive discussions, yet it became an open humiliation of the one of the most important people that will ever be on your side.\u000aV.            Though you have every right to assembly, the message you preached on Wednesday was tainted by the profanity in both your voices and on your signs. On live television, 3 students yelled profanities and the crowd cheered them on. On live television you told the world that we are too immature to handle these issues on our own. On live television, you compromised your legitimacy as educated students and protestors, and instead appeared as though you just wanted someone to blame.There was no room for discussion or debate at your rally, and voices opposed to yours were silenced. You have the freedom of speech to say what you will, as we do so in this letter, but you have publicly humiliated CMC and tarnished your legitimacy as student leaders.\u000aVI.            Jeff Huang, you stood idle as Mary Spellman went through all of this. You were content to sit against the Athenaeum wall while Hiram and Mary took every word spoken to them. You are a Vice President of CMC, and Mary Spellman was often under your directive. It is shameful that you are more protective of your position as an administrator than of your employees, coworkers, and the students of which you are an administrator for. You have as much to answer for to the students of this college as Dean Spellman, and we are disappointed in the lack of your response to any of the events occurring. We have not received a single email or note from you, yet you are supposedly one of the most powerful voices on campus. You did not even show up to the Athenaeum discussions on Friday night. Where\u2019sWaldo Jeff Huang?\u000aVII.            Our grievance with ASCMC lies mainly in the lack of representation of your student population. While we realize that you as individuals have the right to the freedom of speech and assembly, some of you chose to utilize your positions to push for this movement, and by doing so marginalized many students who voted for you. In this sense, we do not feel that we are represented by the Executive Board officers and request that more thought be given to your actions as members of the student government, before participating in actions that would cause your constituents to question whether you truly represent them.\u000aAll these acts were not those of integrity, democracy, and educated CMCers. These actions were the result of emotional and angered students. While your good intentions of reform and change were present, many of your actions proved to have a negative impact on the progress that has been made. Nevertheless, we choose to move on; we have learned from your mistakes and are sure that you will as well.\u000aClaremont McKenna College is a special place. The nation praises us for our tight knit community, the quality of our education, and the professionalism that students display as they dip their feet into the real world. Amongst thousands of applicants, you were chosen because of your merits, to attend a school that many pray to receive a letter of acceptance from. Before you even arrived here at CMC, the college began its preparation to welcome you with open arms into its classrooms, dormitories, and dining halls. CMC\u2019s attitude of not having money become an obstacle for your attendance is the first of many resources that were offered to ensure that you could continue your education without interruption.\u000aNever have we been more divided as a community. Never have we been more humiliated on national television with profanities being yelled at the only college president who will come out and let you berate him for 3 hours. Never did we think we would regret the day we became \u201cBuzzfeed famous\u201d. Never did we think the day would come where we were scared to speak our minds, where fear of our fellow students\u2019 rage silenced us.\u000aNumerous resources have been created in response to the needs of the student body in the past years; the Student Disability Resource Center, the Title IX investigator that now resides on campus, the partnership between the Claremont Colleges and the Project Sister Family Services to provide resources for victims of sexual assault, the Queer Resource Center, and numerous student panels and representative positions. Those are just a fraction of the resources that Claremont McKenna College offers you, and none of these programs and centers resulted from the threats of an angry student movement.\u000aYou are our friends, our family, and people that we talk to everyday, but out of fear for what you might say to us, we held our tongues. But as of this moment, we are speaking up. It is time for the demonstrations and the hostile rhetoric to stop. Hiram and the rest of the administration are offering us seats at the table to resolve these issues together. It would be foolish and immature to reject the opportunity to discuss the inequality issues on campus.\u000aIn fact, as a show of faith, we still promise to help improve the lives of every person in the CMC Community by working with you to fight discrimination and racial intolerance. There are student committees we can form, support groups that can start meeting, and open forums where our voices will be heard. If we can organize such student organizations as well as you organized your demonstrations, there is nothing that will stand in our way of reforming Claremont McKenna College. Together, we can shape the future of CMC, and help change the attitudes of the nation. And we will achieve this through progress, communication, and collaboration.\u000a\u201cWe must develop and maintain the capacity to forgive. He who is devoid of the power to forgive is devoid of the power to love. There is some good in the worst of us and some evil in the best of us. When we discover this, we are less prone to hate our enemies.\u201d\u000a\u2013Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.\u000aWe are grateful for CMC.\u000aVery Respectfully,\u000aNathaniel Tsai,\u000aClaremont McKenna College c/o 2017\u000antsai17@cmc.edu\u000a236 Claremont McKenna College students support this letter. Out of respect for a request of anonymity, those students will not be named publicly. \u000a \u000a \u000a_____________\u000aImage Source: Wes Edwards\u000aShare this:Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)MoreClick to print (Opens in new window)Click to share on Pinterest (Opens in new window)Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)Click to share on Google+ (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Categories: Feature

aS'CMC Administration and Faculty Express Support for Protestors'
p659
aVThis afternoon, Dean of Faculty Peter Uvin sent an email to the student body with an attached letter signed by over 200 CMC students who opposed some aspects of the protests this past week. Uvin flippantly writes, \u201cI received this message last night and totally forgot to forward it to the students. Here it is\u2014better late than never.\u201d\u000a The letter states, \u201cWhile we do not condone the costumes and cultural insensitivity that the girls in costumes displayed, it is not permissible to publicly humiliate and essentially cyber bully girls that have repeatedly apologized.\u201d The letter also expressed disapproval of students\u2019 decision to use a hunger strike to force Dean Spellman resign.\u000a Dean Uvin sent another email right afterwards about \u201cpainful\u201d and \u201cangry\u201d statements that have been made over the past week. \u201cSome communication\u2014foremost on social media, and sometimes by people from outside our campus\u2014has consisted of hurtful ad hominem attack, vitriol, and other disrespectful personal statements,\u201d writes Uvin. Though Uvin notes that such speech is constitutionally protected, he goes on to state, \u201cthese sorts of attacks instill fear and undermine the commitment to mutual respect. This is not the way we want to behave, not [sic] is it this way any of us will achieve our goals in a sustainable manner.\u201d\u000a Dean Uvin ends his email, \u201cPS. Please know that while even aggressive and hurtful statements are covered by the First Amendment, any threats of violence are illegal, violate College policy, and trigger immediate investigation and strong discipline. Please contact us immediately if you experience or observe any such threats.\u201d Uvin also attached some Tips for Dialogue that provides guidelines for how students should talk to one another:

aVDean Spellman,\u000aI\u2019m sorry I am part of a community that contorts attempts at reasonable gestures into acts of \u201cviolence.\u201d  I\u2019m sorry I am part of a community where every word, gesture, and even campaign contribution is subject to judgment and scrutiny by those who claim their mission is to combat judgment and fight for equality.  I\u2019m sorry that I have failed to stand up for my beliefs and your rights as an administrator because as a white, privileged, cis-gendered, able-bodied, male student my views carry no weight in the eyes of the masses and can easily ostracize me as an unsympathetic bigot.  Please know that there are students like myself who think this movement, while rooted in some very concrete details, was carried to incongruous levels and placed administrators in unfair confrontational positions.  We are humans, we make mistakes. A poor word selection should not incite chaos, but rather a dialogue, acknowledgement of wrongdoing, and plan of action for the future.  You made those attempts, yet had no positive reception.  I am deeply saddened by the stain the public response has left on our faculty and campus name.\u000aI wish you the best of luck on your future endeavors.\u000aSincerely,\u000aBen Sacks\u000aShare this:Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)MoreClick to print (Opens in new window)Click to share on Pinterest (Opens in new window)Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)Click to share on Google+ (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Tags: Claremont Independent Claremont McKenna College Dean SpellmanCategories: Guest Opinion

aVThe student protests that have swept through Claremont McKenna College (CMC) over the past few days\u2014and the ensuing fallout\u2014have made us disappointed in many of those involved.\u000a First, former Dean Mary Spellman. We are sorry that your career had to end this way, as the email in contention was a clear case of good intentions being overlooked because of poor phrasing. However, we are disappointed in you as well. We are disappointed that you allowed a group of angry students to bully you into resignation. We are disappointed that you taught Claremont students that reacting with emotion and anger will force the administration to act. We are disappointed that when two students chose to go on a hunger strike until you resigned, you didn\u2019t simply say, \u201cso what?\u201d If they want to starve themselves, that\u2019s fine\u2014you don\u2019t owe them your job. We are disappointed that you and President Chodosh put up with students yelling and swearing at you for an hour. You could have made this a productive dialogue, but instead you humored the students and allowed them to get caught up in the furor. \u000a Above all, we are disappointed that you and President Chodosh weren\u2019t brave enough to come to the defense of a student who was told she was \u201cderailing\u201d because her opinions regarding racism didn\u2019t align with those of the mob around her. Nor were you brave enough to point out that these protesters were perfectly happy to use this student to further their own agenda, but turned on her as soon as they realized she wasn\u2019t supporting their narrative. These protesters were asking you to protect your students, but you didn\u2019t even defend the one who needed to be protected right in front of you.\u000a Second, President Chodosh. We were disappointed to see you idly stand by and watch students berate, curse at, and attack Dean Spellman for being a \u201cracist.\u201d For someone who preaches about \u201cleadership\u201d and \u201cpersonal and social responsibility,\u201d your actions are particularly disappointing. You let your colleague, someone who has been helping your administration for the past three years and the college for six years, be publicly mocked and humiliated. Why? Because you were afraid. You were afraid that students would also mock and humiliate you if you defended Dean Spellman, so you let her be thrown under the bus. You were so afraid that it only took you five minutes to flip-flop on their demand for a temporary \u201csafe space\u201d on campus. Your fear-driven action (or lack thereof) only further reinforced the fear among the student body to speak out against this movement. We needed your leadership more than ever this week, and you failed us miserably. \u000a Third, ASCMC President Will Su. As the representative of CMC\u2019s entire student body, we are disappointed in you for the manner in which you called for the resignation of junior class president Kris Brackmann and for so quickly caving in to the demands of a few students without consulting the student body as a whole. If you truly cared about representing all of CMC\u2019s interests, you would have at the very least solicited opinions from outside of the movement and your Executive Board. You have shut down any room for debate among the student body with your full endorsement of this movement and its demands, failing to give concerned students an opportunity to speak. We are disappointed that you did not allow for any time for reflection before making your quick executive decisions to announce a student-wide endorsement of this movement and to grant these students a temporary \u201csafe space\u201d in the ASCMC offices.\u000a To our fellow Claremont students, we are disappointed in you as well. We are ashamed of you for trying to end someone\u2019s career over a poorly worded email. This is not a political statement\u2014this is a person\u2019s livelihood that you so carelessly sought to destroy. We are disappointed that you chose to scream and swear at your administrators. That is not how adults solve problems, and your behavior reflects poorly on all of us here in Claremont. This is not who we are and this is not how we conduct ourselves, but this is the image of us that has now reached the national stage. \u000a We are disappointed in your demands. If you want to take a class in \u201cethnic, racial, and sexuality theory,\u201d feel free to take one, but don\u2019t force such an ideologically driven course on all CMC students. If the dearth of such courses at CMC bothers you, maybe you should have chosen a different school. If students chose to attend Caltech and then complained about the lack of literature classes, that\u2019s on them. And though it wouldn\u2019t hurt to have a more diverse faculty, the demand that CMC increase the number of minority faculty members either rests on the assumption that CMC has a history of discriminating against qualified professors of color, or, more realistically, it advocates for the hiring of less qualified faculty based simply on the fact that they belong to marginalized groups. A hiring practice of this sort would not benefit any CMC students, yourselves included. \u000a We are disappointed in the fact that your movement has successfully managed to convince its members that anyone who dissents does so not for intelligent reasons, but due to moral failure or maliciousness. We are disappointed that you\u2019ve used phrases like \u201csilence is violence\u201d to not only demonize those who oppose you, but all who are not actively supporting you. We are most disappointed, however, in the rhetoric surrounding \u201csafe spaces.\u201d College is the last place that should be a safe space. We come here to learn about views that differ from our own, and if we aren\u2019t made to feel uncomfortable by these ideas, then perhaps we aren\u2019t venturing far enough outside of our comfort zone. We would be doing ourselves a disservice to ignore viewpoints solely on the grounds that they may make us uncomfortable, and we would not be preparing ourselves to cope well with adversity in the future. Dealing with ideas that make us uncomfortable is an important part of growing as students and as people, and your ideas will inhibit opportunities for that growth.\u000a We are adults, and we need to be mature enough to take ownership of and responsibility for our feelings, rather than demanding that those around us cater to our individual needs. The hypocrisy of advocating for \u201csafe spaces\u201d while creating an incredibly unsafe space for President Chodosh, former Dean Spellman, the student who was \u201cderailing,\u201d and the news media representatives who were verbally abused unfortunately seemed to soar over many of your heads.\u000a Lastly, we are disappointed in students like ourselves, who were scared into silence. We are not racist for having different opinions. We are not immoral because we don\u2019t buy the flawed rhetoric of a spiteful movement. We are not evil because we don\u2019t want this movement to tear across our campuses completely unchecked. \u000a We are no longer afraid to be voices of dissent.\u000a_____________\u000aHannah Oh, Editor-in-Chief\u000aSteven Glick, Publisher\u000aTaylor Schmitt, Managing Editor\u000a_____________\u000aImage: CMC Forum

aS'Dean Spellman Resigns Following Student Protest'
p671
aVEarlier today, Mary Spellman resigned from her position as Assistant Vice President and Dean of Students at Claremont McKenna College. The resignation occurred in response to a protest that took place yesterday, which was centered on the idea that Dean Spellman had not done enough to create a safe space on campus for students from marginalized backgrounds. The protests were catalyzed by an email Spellman sent to a student in response to an article that student had written for The Student Life earlier this week.\u000a\u201cSince 2010 I have been privileged to serve as Dean of Students at Claremont McKenna College,\u201d states Spellman in her email resignation. \u201cToday I am submitting my letter of resignation, effective immediately. I do so with sadness beyond words, because these nearly six years have been the most rewarding and fulfilling of my life, but also with the conviction that it is the right thing to do for the school and the students I care about so deeply.\u201d\u000aThough many students pushed for Spellman\u2019s resignation\u2014including two students who went on a hunger strike\u2014not everyone on campus shared this sentiment. In her email, Spellman notes that one student wrote to her, \u201cYou\u2019ve inspired me in my time at CMC.  Please stay strong and realize students like me need you to stay here\u2026I will always be honored to consider you a mentor, a role model, and above all, friend.\u201d\u000aAdditionally, a faculty member wrote, \u201cI also recognize how much you have worked to make our community more inclusive\u2026 I know I join many fellow faculty members and students in expressing my full support and confidence in you as Dean of Students here at CMC.\u201d\u000aSpellman closes her email by stating, \u201cTo all who have been so supportive, please know how sorry I am if my decision disappoints you.  I believe it is the best way to gain closure of a controversy that has divided the student body and disrupted the mission of this fine institution.  Most important, I hope this will help enable a truly thoughtful, civil and productive discussion about the very real issues of diversity and inclusion facing Claremont McKenna, higher education and other institutions across our society.\u201d\u000aShare this:Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)MoreClick to print (Opens in new window)Click to share on Pinterest (Opens in new window)Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)Click to share on Google+ (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Tags: Claremont Colleges Claremont McKenna College Dean SpellmanCategories: Campus News

p675
aVYesterday afternoon, a student demonstration took place at Claremont McKenna College (CMC), where students of marginalized identities demanded administrative officials accommodate their specialized needs on campus. Their demands include a permanent resource center; the immediate creation of two diversity positions for student affairs and faculty; and a general education requirement for ethnic, racial, and sexuality theory; along with over a dozen other demands listed in their original letter to President Hiram Chodosh sent earlier this year. The demonstration\u2019s organizers include the CMCers of Color, the Brothers and Sisters Alliance (BSA), Sexuality and Gender Alliance (SAGA), Asian Pacific American Mentors (APAM), and GenU.

p679
aVLast night, a student proposal to start a DreamCatchers Foundation affiliate club was \u201ctabled indefinitely\u201d at the Pitzer College student senate meeting. Senators expressed concerns that the term \u201cdreamcatchers\u201d was a form of cultural appropriation towards Native Americans. The club was intended to be a campus branch of the national DreamCatchers Foundation, an organization that helps create happy experiences, or \u201cdreams,\u201d for terminally ill hospice patients. The club was initially proposed to the Pitzer Senate by Janu Patel (PZ \u201919) on November 1, where it was tabled for one week. At last night\u2019s senate meeting, the proposal was tabled indefinitely by a vote of 16 to 9.\u000a\u201cLast Sunday, during our weekly meeting, the legislature had the opportunity to review a student organization application for the DreamCatchers Foundation,\u201d stated Senate Treasurer Chance Kawar (PZ\u2019 17) in an email to the student senate obtained by the Claremont Independent. \u201cSome student senators indicated that Native American community members ought to be consulted about the legitimacy of the organization\u2019s name, prior to approving the application.\u201d\u000aFollowing the senate meeting, Kawar received a statement from Scott Scoggins, the Native American Pipeline Director and Outreach Liaison for Pitzer College. Scoggins said that the DreamCatcher Foundation \u201cseems like a worthy organization in their goals and mission,\u201d but \u201ctheir choice of logo and name is problematic and is, I believe, an example of cultural appropriation.\u201d\u000aAdditionally, Scoggins pointed out the fact that \u201cthe DreamCatchers Foundation does not explicitly indicate that it serves any Native nation or group in the Los Angeles area.\u201d He continued to argue that \u201ca corporation with a logo containing explicit Native imagery that doesn\u2019t serve Native communities or affiliated with a Native organization is cultural appropriation.\u201d\u000aSome senators felt that these arguments were sufficient enough to provide evidence of cultural appropriation. In an interview with the Claremont Independent, Gregory Ochiagha (PZ \u201918), a Special Constituency Representative, stated, \u201cWe have the Native American Liaison saying he believes it is cultural appropriation. We have a Native American student representative saying that it is cultural appropriation and that he feels uncomfortable. So to the question of whether it was cultural appropriation: yes, to Native American people, it\u2019s cultural appropriation.\u201d\u000aOther senators were concerned about how the senate would look if it approved the DreamCatchers Foundation. \u201cThe name \u2018DreamCatcher Foundation\u2019 would appear next to Pitzer College on their website, as well as student senate\u2019s,\u201d said Lora McManus (PZ \u201918), a member of the senate\u2019s Diversity Committee, in an interview with the Claremont Independent. \u201cAre we as a body ok with that? Is this how we want our school to be represented?\u201d\u000aKawar also emailed Caitlin Crommett, the founder and CEO of the DreamCatchers Foundation. Crommett, whose family is part of the Penobscot tribe of Maine, replied that she is \u201ca bit surprised by your [the senators\u2019] concern regarding cultural appropriation.\u201d Crommett stated that she has collected dreamcatchers for her entire life, and that her organization gives patients dreamcatchers as reminders of their experience. \u201cFor these reasons alone,\u201d Crommett continues, \u201cI believe that our foundation\u2019s name of DreamCatchers is highly relevant to our work, and not at all cultural appropriation because of the respectful way in which we conduct our work.\u201d\u000a\u201cWe have in fact granted Dreams for Native American patients and spoken with them at length about the name,\u201d noted Crommett. \u201cIn these cases, they have been fully supportive and interested in our name, and have in no way expressed a distaste or disappointment in the use of an element of Native American culture to represent the positive, beneficial work we do.\u201d\u000aPatel, who has been involved with the DreamCatchers Foundation since she was in high school, offered to partner with Native American groups on campus and help them with their events. Patel emphasized that the club would be doing good things, and that she wanted to further the organization\u2019s mission at Pitzer.\u000aDespite these efforts, student senators did not support the club proposal. \u201cI do think a club like that needs to exist,\u201d stated Ochiagha. \u201cBut because it is a cultural appropriation issue, and additionally because I don\u2019t think the national organization is doing that much really to support a Pitzer College charter, I think we should just create a Pitzer club with the same exact purpose, with our own name that\u2019s PC-friendly.\u201d\u000aThe Pitzer Senate told Patel that they might be able to approve the DreamCatchers Club if she were able to use a different name. \u201cI did try to talk to her [Crommett] about changing just the name for Pitzer,\u201d Patel said in an interview with the Claremont Independent. \u201cThey said that since I want it to be a chapter of their organization, I have to keep the name.\u201d\u000a____________________________________\u000aImage Source: Flickr\u000aShare this:Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)MoreClick to print (Opens in new window)Click to share on Pinterest (Opens in new window)Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)Click to share on Google+ (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Tags: Pitzer College Political Correctness steven glickCategories: Campus News

aS'Why Trump?'
p683
aVMy dad thinks Donald Trump is an idiot. But he nevertheless remains a vocal supporter of the man. Why? Why do millions of Americans support a man whose only redeeming quality seems to be an uncanny ability to spew emotionally charged rhetoric? Common justifications around the 5Cs explaining Trump\u2019s lead in the polls include \u201cit\u2019s because Republicans are a party of racists\u201d and because Trump panders to conservatives\u2019 \u201cinfantile paranoia.\u201d Others instead conclude that the rise of Donald Trump is simply the culmination of the decades of inequality and bigotry they consider to be inherent in the Republican constituency. While such blanket generalizations may make it easy to rationalize Trump\u2019s lead and deride the opposition, the real driving force behind the ascendancy of Donald J. Trump is the ever-growing number of Americans who are beginning to resist the ideological left\u2019s sweeping movement towards political correctness.\u000aThe 5Cs are a microcosm of what America is becoming. We go to schools where \u201cYacht Club\u201d is rejected for being classist, \u201cMudd Goes Madd\u201d is considered offensive, and being the top-ranked college in America is a bad thing. We are receiving our education at a place where opinions seen as outside of the status quo are smothered in a flurry of moralizing and politically correct drivel. And Claremont is just a sample of the vapid culture that has taken over America. Unsurprisingly, people are beginning push back.\u000aAn increasing number of Americans feel that PC culture has gone too far and has reached a level bordering on the absurd. And yet, these same people are often afraid to voice their own opinions. A person in America who goes against this current PC state of affairs is labeled any number of pejoratives. Many people who adhere to an even slightly conservative ideology feel stifled by such backlash, often altering or entirely curtailing their opinions so as to avoid being hounded by the PC establishment. The only person who seems truly unafraid to stand up and speak out is\u2014you guessed it\u2014The Donald. And people flock to him for just this reason. People do not support Trump for his policies, his business acumen, or his wealth. They do not even support him because they think he is the best candidate. They support him because he appears to be the only candidate who says what he means and means what he says.\u000aNo one can deny that Donald Trump is a man who speaks his mind and says what he thinks without any regard for whether it could offend someone. And even if he does end up offending someone, an apology is the furthest thing from his mind. Trump might just be the manifestation of all things anti-PC\u2014and people love him for it. Millions of Americans are tired of constantly equivocating politicians; they hate to watch supposed political leaders beating around the bush in fear that they will offend the PC police. And millions of Americans respect Trump because he refuses to cave to those exact same pressures. They cannot help but voice their support for a man who stands up to the virulent culture that has silenced so many. Ultimately, they may not even like the things that he says; they simply love the manner in which he says them.\u000aThe American people are rational\u2014even Republicans. I do not believe they will nominate or elect a megalomaniac. But their support for Trump in the interim is a telling sign that politically correct culture is suffocating an increasingly significant part of this country. America is a diverse country with a multitude of backgrounds and an even greater multitude of opinions. And every opinion, no matter how controversial it may seem, deserves to be heard. Understanding the reasons why someone believes what they do is a crucial part in finding common ground, and in showing them the merits of your own position. The typical knee jerk reaction by the establishment in both the 5Cs and abroad, calling any dissident some sort of \u201c-ist\u201d or \u201c-phobe\u201d, serves only to further divide this country and exacerbate its problems. Such impulsive responses lead to things like Donald Trump being a viable presidential candidate, and nobody really wants that.\u000a_________________________\u000aImage: Flickr\u000aShare this:Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)MoreClick to print (Opens in new window)Click to share on Pinterest (Opens in new window)Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)Click to share on Google+ (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Tags: 2016 election donald trump Political CorrectnessCategories: Opinion

aS'Students Condemn Project Vulva for \xe2\x80\x98Transmisogyny\xe2\x80\x99'
p687
aVLast Thursday, students at Scripps College hosted an event at The Motley called \u201cProject Vulva\u201d to initiate dialogue about the stigmatization of vulvas in society. \u201cWhy is it that, generally, society is so comfortable with the image of the penis and vulvas are considered taboo?\u201d states Project Vulva\u2019s Facebook page. \u201cIn middle school people would scribble penis pictures on the desks in the classroom. There is always that kid who passes out at the party and someone draws a dick on his face.\u201d \u000aProject Vulva\u2019s organizers described the event as \u201can educational and interactive art show displaying your friends [sic] depictions when we asked them, \u2018Can you draw a vulva?\u2019 We will also have cupcakes that you can decorate like vulvas. Supplies are limited!\u201d The event\u2019s stated goal was \u201cto create an open dialouge [sic] educating people about the vulva in order to confront society\u2019s stigmas and stereotypes, and make people more comfortable with the many varying images and types of cis and non-cis vulvas.\u201d\u000aHowever, the event faced harsh backlash from students who found it offensive to the trans community. One student, who felt that Project Vulva\u2019s claim that penises are not stigmatized was untrue, wrote, \u201cSociety is not comfortable with the image of a penis on a woman. This event feels extremely transmisogynistic and to say penises are universally accepted as non-taboo is transmisogynistic. I can\u2019t say I\u2019m surprised though. There are infinitely many ways to celebrate genitals without making transmisogynistic remarks in the process.\u201d\u000aAnother commenter wrote, \u201cRight like this entire event is so incredibly violent to trans women specifically. I\u2019m so disgusted.\u201d The comment went on to state, \u201cEquating genitalia to a person\u2019s gender is and always will be transphobic.\u201d\u000aIn defense of the event, one student tried to clarify the event\u2019s description and commented, \u201cI\u2019m not really trying to protect transmisogyny and I honestly don\u2019t know why you\u2019d accuse me of that.\u201d However, the comment only sparked further backlash. \u000a\u201cI don\u2019t need your help parsing out the finer details of this garbage, cis, white event,\u201d responded one commenter. \u201cA trans woman is telling y\u2019all this makes her feel uncomfortable and that\u2019s not enough for you to rethink your stance on this? You\u2019re gross, this whole thing is gross, have fun with your ugly cupcakes.\u201d\u000aThe conversation intensified as more people defended the event, with one commenter arguing that students have a right \u201cto try to explain our purpose and ask questions when attacked.\u201d This outraged other students who felt that the word \u201cattacked\u201d has racist connotations. \u000a\u201cThese women did not \u2018attack\u2019 you or your event,\u201d replied one student. \u201cYou responded to their very very very credible and personal (as trans women of color) critique by using racialized terms (such as \u2018attack\u2019) to discredit their actions and hence discredit anything they are pointing out to you. That is wrong and racist.\u201d\u000aIn response to these concerns, one of Project Vulva\u2019s organizers wrote, \u201cIt has come to our attention that certain aspects of our project implied a binary perception of gender, as well as a limited relationship between gender and genitalia. We apologize to those offended. We strive to be as inclusive as possible, which is why we are doing our best to incorporate all viewpoints into discussion. We hope that everyone can attend our event and continue to have progressive conversations.\u201d\u000aAdditionally, officials from The Motley issued a statement: \u201cThe Motley wants to validate and support the critiques that have been voiced concerning Project Vulva. We are deeply sorry for the hurt experienced by the trans community both in the space of the Motley and on the Scripps campus in general. Being a privileged and exclusive space has long been imbedded in our herstory, and though we have tried and are trying to become an inclusive space where everyone can feel safe and accepted, we recognize that we have failed.\u201d\u000a____________________\u000aImage: Pinterest\u000aShare this:Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)MoreClick to print (Opens in new window)Click to share on Pinterest (Opens in new window)Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)Click to share on Google+ (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Tags: project vulva Scripps CollegeCategories: Campus News

p691
aVIt\u2019s been about a year since I joined the Claremont Independent staff. I wrote my first article about an America-themed party that students protested heavily a few months before. I had been upset about the protest for quite some time, but I was too nervous to say anything about it for fear of social ostracism. As a result, I kept my opinions to myself for a long while. However, when George Will was disinvited from speaking at Scripps last year, I hit my tipping point. I was fed up with the way non-progressive ideas were shunned at the 5Cs, and decided to finally join the CI.

aVWhen I was less than a year old, doctors told my parents that something was different about my interactions with the world. At age three, they suggested that I had Asperger\u2019s Syndrome. Seventeen years later, my family dropped the news on me. While I\u2019m glad my family waited until I was ready to hear the news, the revelation hit me like a freight train halfway through my second semester of college. I always knew I wasn\u2019t comfortable in my own skin. I always knew I had a hard time connecting and relating to people, especially in large groups. Watching Abed Nadir, a character on Community who displays Aspergers\u2019 characteristics, struck a nerve for me that I didn\u2019t want struck. Looking back, I shouldn\u2019t have been especially surprised. I have friends who also fell on the Autism spectrum, and in the back of my mind I knew we had more in common than I wanted to admit. Today, I both accept and embrace my personality, quirks, social awkwardness, naivety, niche interests, and all. While this was not an easy journey, I found that the student body at the Claremont Colleges is incredibly accepting, though not fully informed, of struggles that go hand in hand with non-neurotypical persons.\u000aPeople often refer to Claremont as a bubble, for better or for worse. For whatever reason, the media\u2019s irrational fear of ASD (Autism Spectrum Disorder) has not penetrated this bubble. I remember recently coming forward as being on the autism spectrum \u2013 my three friends listening assured me that, though they had always known I was a tad quirky and blurted things out for no apparent reason, no label would change the nature of our relationship. \u000aFor others, it\u2019s a little more difficult to know how to respond when I tell them I have Asperger\u2019s. Recently, someone with good intentions told me, \u201cFor a guy with Asperger\u2019s, you\u2019re super articulate and cool!\u201d While I\u2019m certain she didn\u2019t mean any harm, the stigma surrounding ASD implies we\u2019re not naturally articulate or cool. Since day one of orientation, Claremont students are groomed to accept their peers, regardless of income, race, orientation, gender identity, etc. \u000aPerhaps we don\u2019t talk about mental health as a community because we\u2019re afraid of stepping on toes. Too often, we\u2019re quick to associate mental health issues with weakness. So many view ASD \u2013 or any mental health issues, for that matter \u2013 as a death sentence. There is no doubt that I have faced struggles, such as not learning to tie my shoes until I was twelve, that other kids didn\u2019t have to face. Asperger\u2019s should not be viewed as a social death sentence, in spite of the struggles that may come along with it. Moreover, ASD in particular has other advantages. People with autism tend to excel at certain skills, such as \u201cidentifying patterns and memory recall,\u201d which are particularly beneficial in the sciences. Like any trait, ASD comes with pros and cons, and to stigmatize it and tiptoe around the issue doesn\u2019t help anyone. We\u2019re perfectly okay with talking about inequality stemming from race, sexual orientation, and gender, and it makes sense to humanize people in the mental health community by including us in the discussion. It\u2019s better to risk stepping on toes and subsequently correct any mistakes than to erase the members of this community.\u000aLike many people, neurotypical or not, I want to be accepted by my community for who I am. Accepting me does not mean that you should treat me like I have a life-crippling disorder. For instance, the name of the \u201cMudd Goes Madd\u201d party did not trigger anxiety, flashbacks, or other negative mental states for me. Between the event photo and characterizing Mudd students as mad scientists, it was evident that the party was not a jab at non-neurotypical people. When ASPC denounced the party for trivializing issues related to mental health, ASPC was essentially telling me that it equates any mental health issues with madness. It\u2019s both patronizing and insulting that ASPC assumes that ASD cripples me and implies that I can\u2019t handle the real world and its challenges. \u000aWhat ASPC doesn\u2019t understand is that the way to encourage inclusivity in the Claremont community is not to tell me that my Asperger\u2019s is a death sentence. The way to include non-neurotypical people in the Claremont community is to engage with us: make us feel welcome. Invite us to your parties, wave to us across North Quad, and perhaps most importantly, understand that we want to be accepted and respected, just like you accept and respect all your other friends. I am proud of my Asperger\u2019s \u2013 quirks and all. Students shouldn\u2019t feel guilty about being neurotypical anymore than they should about being, straight, white, or male. To this end, treating peers in the mental health community with dignity and respect is the best way to foster an inclusive environment on campus.\u000a_________________________________________\u000aImage Source: Flickr\u000aShare this:Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)MoreClick to print (Opens in new window)Click to share on Pinterest (Opens in new window)Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)Click to share on Google+ (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Categories: Opinion

aS'Speak Our Language: How the GOP Can Win the Latino Vote'
p699
aV\u201cAnd so, I do give interviews in Spanish, and here\u2019s why: because I believe that free enterprise and limited government is the best way to help people who are trying to achieve upward mobility. And if they get their news in Spanish, I want them to hear that directly from me. Not from a translator at Univision.\u201d \u2013 Senator Marco Rubio \u000aIn the middle of July, I had the opportunity of a lifetime. I was chosen to volunteer at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library for the 2nd GOP Presidential Primary debate in my hometown of Simi Valley, CA, which was pretty much a dream of mine since high school. On the day of the debate, we arrived at the overfilled parking lot, ready to undertake our duties. Upon entering the shuttle to the library, tensions arose quickly. Protestors were lined up on the sidewalk, showing their opposition to the GOP and the presidential debate. \u000aFor my job at the Reagan Library, I followed Barry Bennett\u2014Dr. Ben Carson\u2019s campaign manager\u2014through the spin room. I heard his positive reactions to the debate, including highlights of Dr. Carson\u2019s strong performance, along with opinions of other like-minded college students. Most of the students who are open about politics at the 5Cs support liberal and socialist policies, making it hard to share conservative ideas without being immediately labeled as an outsider, regardless of your background. Despite identifying as Latino, low-income, and a first-generation college student, once you\u2019re known as a politically conservative person, your credibility disappears and your support groups are essentially lost.\u000aObserving Latino protesters rallying against Donald Trump and the party\u2019s lack of attention for Latino issues and their vote was comforting, but I felt a small sense of betrayal seeing my people protesting against the GOP as I rode a shuttle to the library. Even though I support the GOP\u2019s economic policy more than the Democrats, I still oppose their anti-immigration stance and nativist fear-mongering. Balancing conflicting policy stances with my personal beliefs and feelings is always difficult, but this conflict is normal in a two-party system.\u000aThe GOP has had a miserable time communicating with Latinos in the U.S. and it has, in some cases, irrevocably harmed its public image. In fact, my parents disapproved of my decision to help in the debate. My mom even used profanity\u2014words I rarely hear come out of her mouth\u2014when I told her I might meet Donald Trump. Most Latinos instead decide to support social liberals and the Democratic Party who portray the image of friendship toward immigrants. Union leaders and socialists mistakenly oppose immigration to the U.S., claiming it lowers the wages of low-skilled Americans already in the country. Immigration, however, is one of the best tools to increase economic prosperity, reduce global income inequality, fill our shortage of skilled talent, and provide immigrants a chance for success.\u000aLatin American countries have a horrible history of colonialism, government intervention, and outright corruption within their public systems. Countries like Mexico, Venezuela, Cuba, Guatemala, and others consistently suffer under both corrupt government and cultural tendencies that stagnate their potential for growth and prosperity. Whether through U.S. intervention or local political corruption, government intervention is to blame. Latino voters need to recognize that Democratic policies only serve to keep us in poverty while promising openness and acceptance. Republican policies are hostile to our families in terms of immigration, military intervention in our homelands, and treatment of our relatives and children. Support for GOP candidates should be given with caution. Plenty of Latino immigrants left or escaped their country to avoid the consequences of an intrusive government. They come to the U.S. and ironically advocate for more government programs and intervention to help their cause. It seems that many of us haven\u2019t learned our lesson yet.\u000aWhen I talked about these issues and viewpoints with other minorities\u2014both at home and in Chicago, where I worked last summer\u2014I was praised for my insights. I rode a bus to the gym before I headed to work during my internship this summer and shared my opinions with some Latino janitors who worked downtown. Just like my family, this group showed a distrust of government bureaucracy, public sector work, Latin American elections, and welfare programs from their history in Mexico and Latin America. However, they were open to my libertarian philosophies, my emphasis on education, and the importance of hard work and persistence embodied by Latinos. One of these seniors had his oldest son start college this semester, all because of the sacrifices he had made for his family. The other two already had older kids who worked as plumbers, electricians, and auto dealership owners catering to Latinos. This alone was motivation enough to continue working hard over the summer.\u000aThe priorities of the Latino community vary from those of the general American voter. Latin American communities value family over all other issues, including government bureaucracy, political parties, and other services funded by authoritative bodies. Uniting Latin American families and keeping those bonds intact require a better immigration policy for all countries, since we care deeply about our families. Residency and/or citizenship and the ability to visit our parents, grandparents, or other relatives in other nations is a plus in terms of pleasing the Latino community and opening up new economic opportunities. A political party that shows care for family unity is an important step toward attracting the Latino vote in America.\u000aEmphasizing institutions that promote the freedom to succeed as an entrepreneur or an independent worker will also attract Latinos to the GOP. Latinos are notorious for running underground economies to avoid burdensome U.S. regulation, including but not limited to auto repair businesses, underground food stands, and many others. Underground economies are not limited to immigrants: the urban poor also rely on the underground economy to sustain their lifestyles. Promoting limited government and allowing immigrants and the poor to build their own businesses would also appeal to many Latinos in the U.S. \u000aThe narrative of independence, perseverance, and unity in relation to the Latino community is missing from the GOP narrative. A sizable group of Latinos dislike government, contrary to popular GOP rhetoric. We value hard work, and we prefer assistance over reliance and dependence on the government. We also enjoy sharing the fruits of our labor with friends and family. Educating communities to make rational choices with their time and resources will help us escape poverty and contribute to the country that accepted us in our time of need. When the GOP learns to argue these viewpoints and actually invest some time into Latin American history, they may start winning elections and carry the Latino vote in the future.\u000a_______________________________\u000aImage Source: Flickr\u000aShare this:Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)MoreClick to print (Opens in new window)Click to share on Pinterest (Opens in new window)Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)Click to share on Google+ (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Categories: Opinion

aS'Avoiding the Buzzers'
p703
aVA few summers ago, I sat down with my friend, Mike, for dinner before we returned to our respective schools for another semester. Mike is a really smart, sweet guy; he\u2019s the one in your group who would make all of your friends late for something because your parents wouldn\u2019t stop talking to him.\u000aMike is also an observant Methodist. When we sat down, I decided to ask Mike about something that I had always wanted to know, something that used to actually terrify me when I was younger. \u201cMike,\u201d I said, \u201cdo most Christians think Jews are going to hell?\u201d My teammates from my high school football team are some of my best friends. I was the only Jewish guy in the group, and a lot of my teammates had never spent any time around Jews. I occasionally felt as if there were subtle gaps in our understanding of one another.  Mike paused, collected his thoughts, and said, \u201cUnfortunately, a lot of them do.\u201d He then proceeded to give me a very thorough explanation of why that was and why it was not an entirely ubiquitous belief throughout the Christian faith. I was very pleased with how the conversation went; I learned what I wanted to learn and I felt we grew closer to one another thanks to the honest, direct interaction we shared.\u000aLooking back, I wonder how that conversation could have gone \u2013 or whether it would have even taken place at all \u2013 had we both decided to be politically correct with one another. I may have avoided directly asking the question out of fear of offending him by generalizing and including him in a group stereotyped for their closed-mindedness. Mike may have worried about making me feel bad and not given me a complete answer. Or, he may have immediately gotten defensive and focused on how he himself was different from the \u201cbad\u201d Christians who held a discriminatory belief rather than answering the question I had asked. In either case, we both would have been so preoccupied with meticulous phrasing to avoid offending one another that we would have had a hard time being honest about the issue. \u000aPolitical correctness has good intentions: it seeks to facilitate effective communication and relations between people of different groups, and ensure that people from different backgrounds are comfortable around each other. It also seeks to alleviate undue stress from those who come from traditionally oppressed backgrounds. However, its method of achieving those goals\u2014namely, eliminating any and all potentially offensive words, ideas, and stereotypes from our conversations\u2014is actually counterproductive. \u000aIn our effort to avoid insensitive interactions, we have swung the pendulum too far. In the past two weeks alone, students at the Claremont Colleges have witnessed first-hand the excessive, albeit well-intentioned, outrage and backlash from those insisting event or club names were somehow insidious. On Sunday, the Pitzer senate rejected the \u201cYacht Club\u201d application on the grounds that it held offensive associations to exclusive institutions and an activity that would exclude lower income students. Despite the fact that the club would make boating and sailing available to all on campus, it was dismissed as a \u201cclassist\u201d activity that would be inaccessible for students who were not wealthy.\u000aThe week before that, Pomona\u2019s student government voted to defund Harvey Mudd College\u2019s \u201cMudd Goes Madd\u201d paint party on grounds that it was offensive to students in the mental illness community. Obviously, the party\u2019s planners intended for \u201cMadd\u201d to mean wild with enthusiasm and fun at the party, Pomona\u2019s student representatives insisted that this reference to \u201cgoing mad,\u201d a phrase traditionally used to discredit those with mental illness, was furthering the institutionalized ableism encountered daily at Harvey Mudd and at the 5Cs at large. These examples of hypersensitivity coming from institutional bodies are also seen on a group and interpersonal level of the students who compose them. \u000a \u201cMudd Goes Madd\u201d is not the first time we have seen an event name raise ire from the politically correct community. Two years ago, the America-themed Pub was widely disparaged on social media for being supportive of America\u2019s racist and imperialist past. According to these students, the event celebrating America was an ode to deplorable events such as the Jim Crow laws or Japanese internment camps. Students insisted that any prideful nationalism could not be teased out from the more sinister part of America\u2019s history. Any figurative flag-waving to be had at this event was tantamount to directly celebrating disparities and injustices present in American history or modern society. \u000a Allow me to contrast this in a personal example. Oktoberfest is a 5C party that happens every fall that includes beer and elements of German culture in reference to the annual Oktoberfests that happen every year in Germany. Oktoberfest began in Munich and evolved to be a celebration of Bavarian and German culture. If I, as a Jew, were to take the same stance as those who protested the America-themed pub, I would say that this party is morally repugnant. How dare they celebrate the culture of a country that orchestrated the genocide of millions of my people? And how dare they celebrate the city celebrated as the birth of the Nazi party outside of which the first concentration camp was built? However, I don\u2019t do this because I know that when people say \u201cprost!\u201d and eat bratwurst it is not equivalent to saying \u201cHeil Hitler.\u201d  The same way that attending an America-themed pub does not demonstrate your implicit support for the Trail of Tears. \u000aDo you remember the game \u201cOperation,\u201d where you try to pick out the bones from the man on the table while avoiding the buzzers? Let\u2019s think of successfully removing the bones as the effective communication and learning that happens between different groups around sensitive issues. Some buzzers, like pejorative words, are meant to be there because they invariably hinder effective communication. However, in our effort to avoid these buzzers, we have actually made them much larger. By introducing entire concepts and lexicons we have to avoid mentioning directly or even alluding to, we require people to be expert surgeons in order to extract those bones. For example, \u201cmad,\u201d is not a pejorative word but since it can be drawn in connection to the issue of mental illness, it is put on the no-fly list. In light of situations like this, many people elect to not even attempt to communicate and learn because of the high likelihood they will get buzzed. \u000a As long as you are respectful, it is okay to ask and say what you mean. There is a big difference between someone asking me, \u201cWhy do Jews run the banks?\u201d and \u201cWhy do you think there are a disproportionate number of Jews who work in banking and finance?\u201d However, the two questions both seek to understand an apparent disparity between Jews and other groups of people. Someone who is curious about phenomena like this should be able to ask questions and gain a better understanding of these sorts of situations without fear of being crucified for alluding to something that may be offensive. Phrasing is important, but there needs to be a balance so people can feel comfortable and genuine learning can occur. \u000a In his book Synchronicity: The Inner Path to Leadership, Joseph Jawaorsky, founder of the American Leadership forum, which specializes in collaborative leadership, encourages people to engage in dialogue with each other. \u201cDia\u201d and \u201clogos\u201d\u2013the Greek roots that form the word \u201cdialogue\u201d\u2013mean \u201cmeaning flow through,\u201d suggesting that people should come to a conversation without preconceptions and have an honest flow of thoughts and feelings. Most importantly, he notes, you must drop the \u201cundiscussables,\u201d which create roadblocks that hinder effective communication. Our generation finds itself at a point with innumerable undiscussables where we must duck and weave throughout any conversation for fear of the consequences. \u000a This concern is not a political issue; it is an emotional and a human issue. If we avoid entire topics because we think it is not appropriate to ask or talk about them, odds are we will miss out on a lot of really meaningful and educational conversations. This problem is particularly prevalent on college campuses. Some might say that it is better to try to create a \u201csafe\u201d environment completely devoid of triggering words or ideas so that people, especially those of traditionally oppressed backgrounds, can have an easier time learning. However, others, including President Obama, maintain the idea that those \u201csafe\u201d environments are not how you learn and better yourself. In a recent press conference, President Obama said that college is a place to broaden your horizons and learn how to better evaluate information. That environment is at its best when a lot of different ideas are presented and collide. He mentioned that students should not be coddled, and you should not be able to silence someone because you are too sensitive to hear what they have to say. Learning is not always comfortable, but it is better to hit a buzzer once in a while than to risk not learning at all.\u000a____________________________________\u000aImage Source: Flickr\u000aShare this:Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)MoreClick to print (Opens in new window)Click to share on Pinterest (Opens in new window)Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)Click to share on Google+ (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Categories: Opinion

aS'Pitzer Senate: \xe2\x80\x9cYacht Club\xe2\x80\x9d is Too Offensive'
p707
aVAt Pitzer\u2019s weekly student Senate meeting this past Sunday, a proposed Yacht Club was turned down on the grounds that its name was offensive. \u201cStudent Senate voted against this club instatement last night, as the majority of Senators found the name \u2018Yacht Club\u2019 to have a particularly offensive association with Yacht Clubs and a recreation known for being exclusive,\u201d wrote Taylor Novick-Finder (PZ \u201917), an Environmental Senator, in an email on Pitzer\u2019s Student Talk thread.\u000aThe club requested $5000 in funding to go towards renting boats and hiring instructors, though clubs do not have to receive the full amount requested from the Senate (or any money at all) if the Senate approves them. According to Senators, this was only the third club to be rejected by the Senate in the history of Pitzer College. The first two, the Hammock Club and the Cake Club, were denied because they were too similar to existing clubs already funded by Pitzer.\u000aThe Yacht Club\u2019s would-be president, Jordan Fox (PZ \u201916), is also a member of the student Senate at Pitzer. \u201cWe as a Student Senate have overreached our boundaries,\u201d Fox stated in an interview with the Claremont Independent. \u201cWe should be looking for ways to fund clubs that promote a sense of community within the student body.\u201d Fox has never sailed before, and was hoping to start a club that teaches and promotes boating and sailing. \u201cIt\u2019s frustrating that we don\u2019t really have a precedent set as far as which clubs we\u2019re willing to approve and which ones we aren\u2019t. It\u2019s almost like this is a satire at this point.\u201d\u000a\u201cWe were turned down just because of our name,\u201d Fox said. \u201cWe have been trying to talk about the description of the club, but everyone is so focused on the name. We never had intentions of making this club offensive in any way. I certainly never would have thought this name could be considered classist.\u201d\u000aAccording to screen shots obtained by the Claremont Independent, some students felt that the decision to reject the Yacht Club was justified, regardless of its name. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter what it is called, the club itself is a classist and inaccessible activity for people who are not wealthy,\u201d wrote one Pitzer student. \u201cPitzer\u2019s money would be going towards a luxurious classist, elitist yachting activity (alienating students on campus who are lower income) instead of going to support for example queer and trans people of color, disabled students, working class students, indigenous/Native American students, etc.\u201d\u000aOther students disagreed. \u201cI think you are missing the point that this club would open up access to sailing for people who have never been able to experience it, like myself,\u201d wrote Kyle Dalrymple (PZ \u201917), a member of the Senate\u2019s Faculty Executive Committee. \u201cAdditionally, I will stress again the approval of a club has nothing to do with the budget allocated to it.\u201d\u000aSenators also criticized the decision to turn down the Yacht Club based on the precedent set when the Tattoo Club was approved earlier this year. The Tattoo Club\u2019s proposal statement says that the club\u2019s function \u201cwould potentially include but not be limited to: subsidizing transportation to tattooing locations, subsidizing the cost of the tattoos themselves, bringing speakers to the Claremont Colleges, providing information about tattoo related locations and events, and hosting stick and poke parties! (just kidding).\u201d\u000aTypically, the only criteria that the Senate considers when determining whether or not to approve a club is that it uses money from the student activities fund to pay for student experiences (as opposed to commodities), which Yacht Club stated it would do.\u000aOne Senator pointed out the hypocrisy of rejecting Yacht Club when Tattoo Club was funded for the same overarching purpose of opening up access to different experiences.  If anything, subsidizing tattoos for individual students constitutes more of a commodity than renting a boat for students to learn how to sail together. \u201cTaylor\u2019s student talk email was a disgusting misrepresentation of the situation and an attempt to rial [sic] up the student body in opposition to this club instead of having to deal with addressing some of the dangerous precedents set by this body. It should be noted that Taylor was adamantly in favor of tattoo club, which we openly opposed.\u201d\u000aYacht Club\u2019s founders hope that Senate will approve their club if they change its name. \u201cI by no means want anyone to feel uncomfortable. I would just like a space on campus where we as students can enjoy and learn more about sailing, boating, the ocean, and sea chanteys,\u201d said Fox. \u201cAfter the meeting, we are planning to change the name of the club or possibly drop the matter altogether.\u201d\u000a______________________\u000aImage Source: Flickr\u000aShare this:Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)MoreClick to print (Opens in new window)Click to share on Pinterest (Opens in new window)Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)Click to share on Google+ (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Categories: Campus News

aS'ASPC Defends Defunding'
p711
aVYesterday, the Pomona College community received a statement from the Associated Students of Pomona College (ASPC) regarding its decision to revoke funding from Mudd Goes Madd last weekend. The email states,\u000a\u201cLast year, students on Harvey Mudd\u2019s campus started planning an event also titled \u2018Mudd Goes Madd.\u2019 A number of students from the mental health and disability communities protested the name and the framing of the party on the grounds that they trivialize mental health disabilities, and that the concept of \u2018going mad\u2019 has historically been used to discredit individuals with chronic or acute mental illness, especially those who are marginalized in other forms.\u201d\u000aThe email noted that the primary reason ASPC defunded the event was that Mudd Goes Madd\u2019s organizers did not ask students affected by mental illness and disabilities for their feedback on the party\u2019s name\u2013\u2013a step ASPC felt was necessary in planning an event with such an ableist name. ASPC stated, \u201cTo the students that made their voices heard last year and to all of those who belong to the mental health and disability communities: we hear you. You are important to us. We value you. Especially to those who have been traditionally left out of mental health and disability conversations: you matter to us. These issues are always on the forefronts of our minds and are a focus of actions we will take this year.  We will work to represent and amplify your voices: we are here to support you.\u201d\u000aASPC stated that it did not know Pomona students would be unable to attend the event after funding was removed. It is not stated whether knowledge of that information would have changed ASPC\u2019s decision regarding funding.\u000aThe email closed with the statement, \u201cWe will continue to strive for a more inclusive campus and keep inclusivity as a top priority when funding events and clubs.\u201d\u000aAlso included in the email was a note from the Disability, Illness, and Difference Alliance (DIDA), the 5C Disability Mentor Network (5CDMN), and the 5C Mental Health Alliance (MHA), which listed these groups\u2019 complaints pertaining to the party\u2019s name.\u000a\u201cWe are writing because we believe that the conversation around Mudd Goes Madd needs to center the violence [sic] of ableist language and not the technicalities of ASPC\u2019s decision,\u201d the note begins. \u201cWhile we don\u2019t believe that the party planners intended to be ableist by naming the party Mudd Goes Madd, the word still carries a connotation of violence against disabled people.\u201d\u000a\u201cLanguage is only one piece of the complex system of institutional ableism that students encounter daily at Mudd and in the 5Cs at large, but it is one of the most basic ways that we can support our peers,\u201d the letter goes on to state. \u201cIt is important for us to be critical of our language, because the impact of ableist phrases extends beyond someone being offended. Words are used to oppress people.\u201d\u000aThe note states that the party\u2019s name restigmatizes mental illness, and that \u201cMudd Goes Madd erases the history of violence and institutionalization of mentally ill people and constructs madness as being silly and drunk.\u201d\u000aThe letter goes on to state that the name Mudd Goes Madd also stigmatizes alcoholics. \u201cWhat does it mean for Mudd to go \u2018madd\u2019 at this party? Are people mentally ill at the party because they got drunk? Addiction is a mental illness where people\u2019s lives are jeopardized because they have no support. Thinking about partying through a metaphor about alcoholism is unacceptable.\u201d\u000aThe letter continues, \u201cOur disappointment is not about political correctness. Mudd Goes Madd dismisses the needs and wellbeing of disabled students.\u201d\u000aThe letter closes with a call for the permanent banning of the name Mudd Goes Madd. \u201cWe demand that Mudd Goes Madd is no longer used. No event should reference disability without engaging with it in meaningful and critical ways. Event planners must involve disabled students from their own community and DIDA when programming events.\u201d\u000a \u000a____________________________________\u000aImage Source: Wiki Commons\u000aShare this:Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)MoreClick to print (Opens in new window)Click to share on Pinterest (Opens in new window)Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)Click to share on Google+ (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Categories: Campus News

aS'ASPC Gets Madd'
p715
aVEarlier today, the Associated Students of Pomona College (ASPC) voted against funding a 5C party called \u201cMudd Goes Madd\u201d due to the name\u2019s trivialization of mental health issues. The event description on Facebook states:\u000a\u201cJoin your favorite Madd scientists as we get down and dirty with paint for North\u2019s first 5C party of the year! Get covered in gallons of fluorescent (but washable!) paint on September 26th at North Dorm!\u201d\u000aThough seemingly similar to other parties Mudd has hosted in the past (such as \u201cFoam,\u201d which will not be taking place this year), the ASPC committee opposed funding Mudd Goes Madd, which would prevent Pomona students from being able to attend the event. \u000aOne of the hosts for the event, Elise Cassella (HMC \u201918) released the following statement she received from ASPC regarding its decision:\u000a\u201cThe committee has decided against funding your event due to the following reasons:\u000aAfter asking what improvements Mudd North Dorm would make in terms of making one of the first major 5c events of the year safer than previous year, [sic] the answer provided addressed none of the primary concerns, such as crowd control, atmosphere, and security.\u000aWe are disappointed at your choice of the name for the event, as well as your rationale for allowing the name \u2018Mudd Goes Madd.\u2019 Your disregard of the concerns of the mental health community and their allies trivializes the issues that we deem extremely important to our community. Further, the exclusion of the mental health community in the discussion of allowing the event name is inappropriate.\u201d\u000aASPC President Nico Kass (PO \u201916) also released a statement to justify ASPC\u2019s opposition to funding Mudd Goes Madd:\u000a\u201cOn behalf of ASPC Senate, I would like to explain the rationale behind our decision to not fund this event. Most importantly, not only do we believe the name trivializes mental health and disability issues, but despite students\u2019 repeated expression of hurt due to the party name in the past, the event organizers decided to exclude them from the conversation and dismiss their concerns as unimportant.\u201d\u000aASPC\u2019s precaution against using the term \u201cMadd\u201d in order to protect students with mental health issues did not resonate well with students, including those with mental illnesses. Some of these students expressed concerns that ASPC was patronizing them. \u201cAs a guy on the autism spectrum,\u201d responded one anonymous CMC student, \u201cASPC\u2019s reasoning is less than helpful. ASD is a very serious issue, but treating me like I\u2019m five years old and trying to protect me from every possible trigger doesn\u2019t prepare me for the real world.\u201d\u000aSimilarly, another 5C student, who requested anonymity, stated, \u201cI am actually bipolar and I am offended that people infantilize the whole issue of mental illness by suggesting we should be protected from anything that could damage our \u2018fragile\u2019 psyches.\u201d\u000aJeffrey Allen (PO \u201917) had another theory for ASPC\u2019s reasoning to defund the event. \u201cI may be overestimating the ability of Pomona students to behave rationally around anything related to political correctness, but I seriously doubt this has anything to do with the name and has everything to do with ASPC not wanting to spend money. If that is the case, using social justice as a cover for an unpopular decision is truly despicable.\u201d\u000aIn response to the outpouring of opposition, Mudd Goes Madd ultimately decided to open its doors to Pomona students despite the lack of funding. Casella stated, \u201cIn light of all the responses we\u2019ve received and observed, we\u2019ve decided to make the party 5C and allow every 5C student to attend. We just want everyone to be safe and have a good time tomorrow night. The party will proceed as initially intended and if you have any questions or concerns, please feel free to reach out to any of the hosts.\u201d\u000aMudd Goes Madd will take place tomorrow night from 9:00pm to 1:00am at North Dorm.\u000aUpdate: September 25, 2015\u000aElise Casella confirmed that \u201cMudd Goes Madd\u201d has never been used as a party name in the past, contrary to Nico Kass\u2019 statement.\u000aUpdate: September 26, 2015\u000aWhen ASPC made its decision to not fund, it was not aware that it would prevent Pomona College students from attending the event. 5C parties do not have to be funded by all the colleges for their students to attend.\u000aUpdate: September 29, 2015\u000aIn 2010, Harvey Mudd College planned a party with the \u201cMudd Goes Madd\u201d name. http://cmcforum.com/news/02052010-mudd-prepares-for-maddness\u000aUpdate: September 30, 2015\u000aElise Casella clarified that \u201cMudd Goes Madd\u201d was not an event last year, but it has been used as a party name in the past.\u000a________________________________________\u000aImage Source: Flickr\u000aShare this:Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)MoreClick to print (Opens in new window)Click to share on Pinterest (Opens in new window)Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)Click to share on Google+ (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Categories: Campus News

aS'Checking the Logic of Privilege'
p719
aVMost 5C students want to change the world in one capacity or another. How they do so varies \u2013 a Pitzer student and a CMCer, for example, will approach a problem differently. Yet while many set out to improve the world on a global scale, many others choose to focus on eliminating racism, sexism, and other forms of bias here in Claremont. Though this is a noble goal and starting at home has a certain sense to it, the way in which most of us go about achieving it does not: particularly when it comes to tackling the concept of \u201cprivilege.\u201d\u000aThe theory of \u201cchecking your privilege\u201d rests on the central idea that certain people in the U.S. are more oppressed than others. Some groups have fewer socio-economic opportunities and are more likely to experience discrimination than other groups. Everyone experiences some level of oppression, but no one experiences all its forms and nuances to the same degree.\u000aIn its theoretical form, \u201cchecking your privilege\u201d is nothing more than basic human decency, uncomplicated and commonly valued. In practice, however, \u201cchecking your privilege\u201d twists into something toxic: a hierarchical system that feeds the ills it was meant to stave off. Rather than encouraging understanding, it stratifies and isolates groups; rather than incentivizing kindness, it awards power on the basis of shallow, fixed traits.\u000aOn college campuses, \u201cchecking your privilege\u201d has come to mean being subservient to a social hierarchy. The idea is to reverse what some students view as American society\u2019s existing social hierarchy, so that the so-called \u201cmost privileged\u201d are on the lowest rung and the \u201cmost oppressed\u201d are on the highest. Where you fall in this system depends on various categories. The main ones are race, socio-economic status, sexual orientation, ability, and gender. The lowest member in this hierarchy is the neuro-typical, healthy, white, wealthy, heterosexual, cisgender male.\u000a\u201cPrivileged\u201d students must always defer to those above them in the hierarchy, falling quiet when told to and taking their word for everything. One\u2019s position in the hierarchy outweighs the merit of their argument. If a woman calls out a man, she is applauded for speaking truth to power. If a man questions a woman, he\u2019s sexist. If someone higher up than you says you have offended them, you must apologize vociferously and ensure that it will not happen again. And if you ever plan to say something that could be considered offensive, you must preface it with a list of trigger warnings so people can decide whether or not they care to listen to you.\u000aThe first flaw in this system is that it discourages understanding the struggles of others, as the reverse privilege social hierarchy is generally intolerant of mistakes. Anything deemed \u201cclassist,\u201d \u201csexist,\u201d \u201cracist,\u201d \u201ctransphobic,\u201d \u201chomophobic,\u201d \u201cableist,\u201d etc. \u2013 whether it really is one of those things or not \u2013 will result in immediate outrage that can continue even after the transgressor realizes and apologizes. This can still occur even if the individual is only rumored to support \u201cdangerous\u201d ideas. As a result, there is an incentive to take the easiest, most submissive path.\u000aOften, this means focusing only on gender and race, as these traits are the most easily discernible; when you first encounter someone, you can generally ascertain their gender and race immediately. You could pause and learn the nuances of their identity, but the reverse privilege hierarchy incentivizes you not to do so; finding out details about a given individual\u2019s racial or ethnic background, sexual orientation, or socioeconomic status requires extensive questioning, and identity-based questions are typically considered offensive in the new hierarchy (especially when asked by the \u201cprivileged\u201d). Since any perceived offense can result in social ostracism, there is little incentive to try and learn more about your classmates. As a result, gender and race act as trump cards, superseding subtle categories \u2013 such as socioeconomic status \u2013 even when such traits are often more indicative of the level of hardship someone has faced than one\u2019s race or gender.\u000a\u201cChecking your privilege\u201d does not encourage one to understand the full picture of other students\u2019 backgrounds. Even on the off chance one were able to understand every nuance of their fellow students\u2019 personal story, there is still no metric by which to compare them. What means more: one student\u2019s low socioeconomic status or another student\u2019s race? This is a question that cannot be answered.\u000aFurther and perhaps more significantly, the sheer complexity of social systems and the blatant lack of nuance in the reverse privilege hierarchy cause the system to actually reinforce the very systems of oppression \u201cchecking your privilege\u201d is meant to dismantle. Say there is a student who is \u201coppressed\u201d in almost every category (perhaps a black lesbian who is a first-generation immigrant.) But now suppose she actually had an easy upbringing; she grew up in a well-to-do family with loving parents in a progressive town. Now consider a man who is \u201cprivileged,\u201d but grew up with an abusive parent in a low-income household. It is quite possible that he has endured more violence and emotional turmoil over the course of his life than she has, but the privilege system would still to expect him to \u201ccheck his privilege\u201d without expecting the same of her.\u000aSuch a system is precisely the opposite of what \u201cchecking your privilege\u201d is meant to be. However, it is not how our campus has to be. We can and should exemplify the original meaning of \u201cchecking your privilege,\u201d \u2013 namely, treating others with respect and dignity. It would be as simple as incentivizing kind and thoughtful behavior, regardless of an individual\u2019s identity. One\u2019s social capital should rise based on one\u2019s behavior, rather than based on traits like sexual orientation or gender. As it stands, the reverse privilege hierarchy rewards fixed, physical traits. Once the categories are drawn up, that\u2019s it. If we want our campus culture to instill lasting respect and thoughtfulness in its students, we would do well to give up on the oppression Olympics and instead start focusing on our classmates\u2019 character.\u000aShare this:Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)MoreClick to print (Opens in new window)Click to share on Pinterest (Opens in new window)Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)Click to share on Google+ (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Categories: Opinion

aS'Pomona College Faces Discrimination Lawsuit'
p723
aVMatt Harris, 18, is suing Pomona College for $20 million on charges of discrimination. Harris, of Portland, OR, claims that the school violated federal law for failing to recognize his right to self-expression. The lawsuit, filed yesterday, asserts that Pomona College discriminated against Harris based on his identity and barred him from participating in school activities with his peers.\u000aUpon arriving to campus for orientation, Harris was surprised to find that he had not been assigned to a room and was not on the roster for any of Pomona\u2019s Orientation Adventures. When other freshmen were matched with sponsors and given a scheduled time to register for classes, Harris was not. Concerned, he stopped by the Admissions Office in search of an explanation.\u000a\u201cBasically, they told me that they didn\u2019t think people like me belonged at Pomona,\u201d recalls Harris. \u201cThey thought I was different from the other students, and somehow inherently worse. It was really unbelievable to hear comments like that from an administrator at a school that touts itself as so tolerant and open-minded.\u201d\u000aPomona administrators felt that the treatment of Harris was perfectly justified. \u201cThese activities were for Pomona freshmen only,\u201d said Assistant Dean of Admissions Will Hummel. \u201cMatt Harris was not admitted to Pomona. He graduated with a GPA of 2.3 and scored a 1240 on his SAT. While we do use a holistic admissions approach, there\u2019s only so much we can do in situations like this. On his letter of rejection, I recommended that he consider applying to Scripps instead, as he might be better able to contribute to diversity there.\u201d\u000aHarris insists that this is not an issue of qualifications, but rather a classic case of bias. \u201cWhat I don\u2019t understand here is why nobody cares at all about my identity,\u201d said Harris. \u201cI raise my own sage grouse in my backyard, I gave up showering and drinking water long before the drought even started, and I am committed to taking down the colonialist cisheteropatriarchy. I even wear a Che Guevara t-shirt every single day. I self-identify as a Pomona student, whether the admissions office likes it or not, and nobody can take that away from me.\u201d\u000aHarris\u2019 lawyer, who at the time of this writing is named Atticus Larson (Larson is still in the process of having his first name legally changed), noted that he believes Harris\u2019 case has strong precedent in cases pertaining to workplace discrimination.\u000a\u201cEssentially, Pomona rejected my client despite his superior qualifications. Pomona claims that Harris\u2019 grades and test scores make him less capable of succeeding at Pomona, but this is clearly false,\u201d Larson began. \u201cMy client\u2019s credentials show that he is even better qualified than most Pomona students to smoke weed and sleep through his 1:15pm classes while whining about the oppression he faces. The evidence could not be clearer, and I have no doubt the judge will agree.\u201d\u000aVice President and Dean of Students Miriam Feldblum explained that, in response to the controversy surrounding Harris, Pomona is currently in the process of revising its policies pertaining to bias and discrimination. \u201cAt Pomona, we make a conscious effort to avoid discrimination based on one\u2019s race, gender, sexuality, and socioeconomic status,\u201d Feldblum wrote in an official statement. \u201cHowever, it has come to my attention that\u2014for the entire history of the school\u2014we have discriminated against people based on their academic credentials, and that needs to stop. We are currently working toward a solution for a more inclusive Pomona.\u201d\u000a                                                                               \u000aImage: Flickr\u000a \u000aShare this:Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)MoreClick to print (Opens in new window)Click to share on Pinterest (Opens in new window)Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)Click to share on Google+ (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Tags: Claremont Colleges Identity Pomona Satire steven glickCategories: Humor

aS'Why I Was the Luckiest Student at Scripps College'
p727
aVMy heart was beating and my mouth was dry. Dare I challenge my professor\u2019s assertion that Marxism is a better economic system? As I began to speak, fifteen pairs of eyes turned my way\u2026\u000aComing from a family of firm believers in the free market, I was never certain whether my opinions were my own or those of my parents. Leaving home, I looked forward to going to a college where I could encounter a range of viewpoints. Scripps gave me the perfect opportunity to challenge my most closely-held beliefs because I was on my own in a sea of people who disagreed with me. I went into my Core II class, \u201cEat the Rich! Capitalism and Work,\u201d fully committed to evaluating alternative viewpoints.\u000aI read the class materials with curiosity and an open mind, and I came to class prepared to discuss both sides of the issue. Unfortunately, I was the only one who voiced a capitalist perspective. If a class about capitalism does not address both the positives and negatives of the free market, students are not able to develop an informed opinion. While the professor claimed to address both sides of the issue, he rarely, if ever, presented the positive aspects of capitalism. Even more alarming was the fact that the socialist and Marxist readings were required, while the pro-capitalist readings were completely optional.\u000aNow, back to that fateful moment. Overcoming my fears, I clearly stated my case. The professor scrambled for a response. That\u2019s when I realized that I was the luckiest student at Scripps College. I am grateful to have been given the opportunity to challenge my own views, evaluate my long-held beliefs, and articulate my thoughts independently. I am especially grateful that I gained the confidence to stand my ground in a room full of people who disagreed with me. Other Scripps students, however, have not been so lucky in that respect.\u000aAs John Stuart Mill said, \u201cHe who knows only his own side of the case knows little of that.\u201d I challenge Scripps professors and students to explore all perspectives of an issue, so that every student can have the same opportunities that I have had.\u000a______________________________\u000aPhotography by Wes Edwards.\u000aShare this:Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)MoreClick to print (Opens in new window)Click to share on Pinterest (Opens in new window)Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)Click to share on Google+ (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Tags: Academic Freedom Capitalism Marxism Political Diversity Scripps CollegeCategories: Opinion

aS'It\xe2\x80\x99s Time to Stop Blaming Everything on Guns'
p731
aVFollowing the tragic shooting of nine black churchgoers in Charleston, South Carolina this summer, many have called for increased gun control in America. Some have even gone so far as to suggest that guns should be banned altogether. Such reactions are natural in response to a devastating occurrence like this, but gun control policies formed around reducing the number of mass shootings will do little\u2014if anything\u2014to alleviate America\u2019s gun violence problems.\u000aThe gun control measures proposed by the Obama administration focus almost exclusively on trying to reduce the frequency of mass shootings like the one in Charleston. Policies such as banning \u201cmilitary-style assault weapons;\u201d limiting magazine capacities to 10 rounds; providing \u201cactive shooter\u201d training to law enforcement, first responders, and school officials; and plans to improve mental health awareness and make it more difficult for those with mental illnesses to obtain guns are all strategies designed to lower the number of mass shootings in the U.S.\u000aThough shooters like Dylann Roof (the killer behind the Charleston massacre) receive a tremendous amount of attention from the media, such shootings are exceptionally rare. Between 1983 and 2013, there were a total of 78 mass shootings in America (an average of 2.6 mass shootings per year). These shootings claimed a total of 547 lives. Thus, for every American that dies in a mass shooting each year, two Americans die from a dog bite. Is it time to ban dogs? Or at least ban the big, scary-looking ones?\u000aAdditionally, only 23% of mass shooters had a documented psychiatric history and just 6% were determined to have been psychotic during their attack. Thus, individuals with a mental illness perpetrate approximately 4 deaths by mass shooting per year, and mentally ill mass shooters who are psychotic during the attack cause about 1 death per year.\u000aWhile it is important to try and reduce the number of deaths in America (or anywhere else) whenever possible, the costs of banning certain types of firearms or making it more difficult for the mentally ill to obtain a gun will vastly outweigh the benefits. Guns are used for self-defense 80 times as often as they are used to take lives and, notably, handguns (i.e. semiautomatic, concealed weapons) are used in more than 75% of these situations. Typically, gun owners using firearms for self-defense will only use the weapon to fire a warning shot, as guns are used to kill the attacker in just 8% of instances of gun-related self-defense. Additionally, about 200,000 American women use firearms to protect themselves from sexual violence every year, and a Justice Department study found that 60% of felons agreed that a criminal is not going to harm an individual whom he or she knows is armed.\u000aEven though guns are used to prevent murders with far greater frequency than they are used to commit murders, and despite the fact that mass shootings are unlikely, there are still a lot of gun deaths in America every year. As such, many believe that stricter gun control would be beneficial to the U.S. Most gun control advocates view countries like Australia and England as model nations, as civilian gun ownership is prohibited in almost all circumstances there: the Australian government requires that a \u201cgenuine reason\u201d be provided for citizens to even own a paintball gun, and in England not even the police can carry firearms. As a result, there are few gun deaths in these countries. Further, the overall murder rates in Australia and England are noticeably lower than that of the U.S. For proponents of gun control, these comparisons paint a clear picture: \u201cSee? If we banned guns in America, we would save so many lives.\u201d The flaw in this argument lies in its failure to recognize that correlation does not imply causation.\u000aThere are approximately 32,000 gun deaths in the U.S. every year. Of these, approximately 64% are suicides, less than 1.6% are accidental, and the remainder are homicides. To determine whether a ban on guns would save lives in the U.S., it is necessary to compare each of these statistics with those of Australia and England.\u000aIn Australia, the suicide rate in 2013 was 10.9 per 100,000 and in the UK, it was 11.9 per 100,000. In the U.S., the suicide rate was 12.6 per 100,000. Although the U.S. rate is slightly higher than that of Australia and the UK, the disparity disappears when considering the prevalence of depression among Americans relative to citizens of Australia and the UK. While a gun is often the weapon of choice for Americans committing suicide, the availability of firearms does not cause more people to commit suicide.\u000aSimilarly, the rate of accidental gun deaths in America is comparable to the rate of other types of accidental deaths in Australia and the UK. In 2012, there were about as many accidental deaths by firearm per capita in America as there were deaths per capita in Australia from falling out of bed and deaths per capita in the UK from crossing the street. In the U.S., the likelihood of an accidental gun death is approximately half the likelihood of  death by autoerotic asphyxiation. In other words, gun accidents are no more likely to be fatal than any other type of accident.\u000aThe only disparity between the U.S. and the duo of Australia and the UK is the homicide rate. In Australia, there were 430 murders in 2013, which yields a murder rate of approximately 1.86 per 100,000. In the UK, there were 537 murders in 2014 (the fewest there since 1978), a murder rate of approximately 0.84 per 100,000. In the U.S., there were 14,196 murders in 2013\u2014a murder rate of 4.45 per 100,000\u2014which is more than double Australia\u2019s murder rate and over four times that of the UK.\u000aThis disparity can be attributed to the pervasiveness of gangs in America. According to the European Journal of Criminology, \u201creports of gang-related homicides are almost entirely absent from the Eurogang studies.\u201d  In Australia, gangs account for less than 1% of homicides. In the U.S., by contrast, organized crime accounts for approximately 80% of violent crimes. Thus, the non-gang murder rate in the U.S. is 0.89 per 100,000\u2014approximately half that of Australia and equal to that of the UK.\u000aGang-related homicides are related to factors such as drugs, intergang violence, and intragang violence. Mental health issues did not contribute to a large enough percentage of gang homicides to even be included in the National Gang Center\u2019s list of causes for gang violence from 2006-2012. No amount of restrictions or screening based on potential gun buyers\u2019 mental health will reduce gang violence. Chicago, my hometown, has some of the nation\u2019s strictest gun control laws yet still has a higher murder rate than Congo, Bolivia, and South Sudan. To lower the murder rate in the U.S., gangs\u2014not guns\u2014must be stopped.\u000aPolicies formed in response to a tragic event fail to take into account the true reasons for the many guns deaths in the United States. The only way to reduce gun violence in America is to focus on the underlying causes that lead people to commit suicide or homicide. Unfortunately, it\u2019s going to take much more than a ban on guns to solve these problems.\u000a \u000a___________________________________ \u000aImage Source: Flickr\u000aShare this:Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)MoreClick to print (Opens in new window)Click to share on Pinterest (Opens in new window)Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)Click to share on Google+ (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Tags: Claremont Independent Guns steven glickCategories: Opinion

aS'Faith and Religion at the 5Cs'
p735
aVAt the 5Cs, conversations about faith and religion are rare. Perhaps this is due to our generation\u2019s perception that believing in God is anti-intellectual or has no place in modern academia. This perception may have stemmed from the notion that religious people do not believe in certain scientific truths, such as evolution, or that they are not skeptics who are able to critically question ideas but instead believe in moral Truths devoid of logical reasoning.\u000aI myself have struggled to bring my faith and intellectual curiosity together. Through my Philosophy, Politics, and Economics (PPE) seminars and tutorials, I have had the valuable opportunity to engage in rich discussions of human nature, ethics, morality, and justice. But it has not been without challenge, as many of these questions were directly related to my views as a Christian. I struggled to bring something as personal to me as my faith into conversations that are built around factual evidence and reasoned arguments. However, my personal revelation stemmed from this Bible verse: \u201cLove the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind\u201d (Matthew 22:37). I am to love God through the willingness to think deeply and critically about matters of my faith and through the internal struggles of answering my own and others\u2019 questions. Others may argue that personal faith has no place in academic settings, but I\u2019d like to disagree.\u000aIn my classes, when I read literature and documents with biblical references and Judeo-Christian values, I often felt the need to detach myself from views that are grounded in my faith. For instance, when I read John Locke\u2019s Second Treatise of Government for my PPE philosophy seminar, I sometimes felt that I ought to leave my faith at the door when Locke used biblical references, such as the story of Adam to make his argument about private property rights and the state of nature. I struggled to be as objective as possible and tried not to discuss his work from a personal viewpoint. I came to realize, however, that I had value to add to the conversation because of my perspective as a Christian. One of my favorite professors once brought up a memorable quote from the movie, You\u2019ve Got Mail:\u000a\u201cIt wasn\u2019t personal.\u201d\u000a\u201cWhat is that supposed to mean? I\u2019m so sick of that. All that means is that it wasn\u2019t personal to you. But it was personal to me. It\u2019s personal to a lot of people. What is so wrong with being personal anyway? Whatever else anything is, it ought to begin by being personal.\u201d\u000aThe professor stated that even people who claim to be objective are coming from subjective, personal perspectives. We all have our biases, and we each experience the world differently. Personal experiences and backgrounds make us who we are. Striving for objectivity can sometimes strip away the unique and valuable element in each one of us that add depth to the conversations we are able to have with one another.\u000aMany of my peers at the 5Cs who do not ascribe to a faith came from families that did. Some went to religious services regularly before coming to college, perhaps simply because it was a part of their family\u2019s routine. However, after we come to college and become independent, the decision to continue practicing our faiths or attending religious services becomes solely our own. For this reason, whether because of the busyness of college life or because our faith was never truly our own, it is easy for us as college students to stray away from our religion.  Generally, however, people underestimate the immense value of religious or spiritual experiences, and this is what perhaps causes the lack of conversation about them.\u000aDialogue about our religious and spiritual experiences and questions about faith are what ultimately leads us to think about the greatest questions that define our existence. Such conversations need not be either divisive or contentious. It most importantly ought not to be political, with religion\u2013or a lack thereof\u2013being used as a tool to further an agenda. Such discussions should lead us to think more deeply about the most important questions we could ever ask ourselves\u2014the meaning and purpose of life, reasons behind one\u2019s motivation and drive, and one\u2019s ethical and moral values. These are definitely questions that are not exclusive to religious people, but it is true that people\u2019s religious and spiritual experiences can add unique and in-depth insights that would be otherwise left out.\u000aSome of the best conversations I have had about faith were with friends who are not religious or who come from different religious backgrounds. As I talked with them, I gained insight and knowledge about where they were coming from and was able to respect the diversity of values at the 5Cs. Often, it is through such conversations that both parties are able to learn something new and gain a better understanding of each other. Such conversations ought not to be one trying to force one\u2019s ideology on another. It should be an open conversation about why we believe in the things we do.\u000aFor Christians, the Bible teaches us to be gracious, understanding, and humble as we engage in such conversations. I strive to be this way though I am far from perfect, as I believe in a God that has shown me so much forgiveness, love, and grace.\u000a___________________________________\u000aImage: Flickr\u000a

aS'Minimum Wage Promises, Maximum Wage Problems'
p739
aV\u201cThere was this young boy about eleven years old\u2026 and he said, \u2018You know, my mom makes the minimum wage and even though it went up, her hours were cut. So we\u2019re not making any more money. Can you help her?\u2019\u201d \u2013 Hillary Rodham Clinton\u000aIt is a sad reality that young children who grow up in poverty have to worry about whether their parents can make ends meet on a regular basis. Instead of focusing on developing friendships, exploring their surroundings, and experiencing extracurricular activities, kids who grow up in poverty are deprived from fully enjoying these activities, and instead, cope with negative household experiences.\u000aEver since middle school, I was aware of my family\u2019s poor income and lived with that reality throughout high school and college. Poverty has significant negative effects on child development since high levels of adversity heavily stress the brain as it tries to develop. Some kids, like myself, succeed in life despite this adversity, but others remain in poverty for most of their lives.\u000aI call my parents at least once a week to check on things at home. They are low-skilled, low-wage workers. So far their work remains steady, but I worry about the impending increases to California\u2019s state minimum wage that will put their jobs, hours, and government benefits at risk. Work-study students, including myself, will likely see minimum wage boosts from $9 to $10 per hour on January 1, 2016. Those whose parents are from California and are similar to mine risk losing their jobs, in exchange for some students getting paid to sit at the Rains Center or the library and do homework on the clock. Minimum wage increases are not fair for my parents or for the millions of poor citizens trying their best to escape the perpetual cycle of poverty.\u000aDespite the negative effects of minimum wage hikes, many new minimum wage laws were enacted across the country. In Los Angeles (city and county), New York City, Seattle, and the University of California system, employers must pay workers $15 an hour within a couple of years. These raises are mostly seen as a success for working-class Americans holding multiple jobs for a living. Each law is different and affects different demographic make-ups. New York\u2019s increase, for example, only affects fast-food workers, and Los Angeles County\u2019s increase only affects unincorporated areas.\u000aLack of support in Congress has led minimum wage advocates to support state and local initiatives for minimum wage increases, but many of these changes were accomplished using questionable methods. New York arbitrarily raised fast-food worker wages using an advisory board, while LA City Council held debates for only a few days before pulling the trigger. Input from the business community and other opponents to minimum wage increases was widely ignored. Whether or not one supports minimum wage increases, or minimum wage laws in general, the methods used by cities and support groups to achieve these increases are creative at best and manipulative at worst. Preventing further increases to minimum wage rates is the best way to mitigate its several negative effects.\u000aMost arguments on both sides of the minimum wage debate focus on jobs and potential increases in family income. For instance, the Congressional Budget Office\u2019s report on raising  the minimum wage to $10.10 per hour included an estimated average loss of 500,000 jobs (0.3% of the workforce) and a bigger share of increased income being distributed to families already earning more than the federal poverty level. Advocates\u2019 cries for a $15 minimum wage will more than double the current federal rate of $7.25, meaning the effects of this raise will be drastically worse than those in the report.\u000aMinimum wage hikes increase unemployment because they make labor more expensive relative to other inputs like machines and technology. Expensive inputs reduce profits for firms, which leads to lower productivity, higher unemployment rates, and higher prices. Jobs at these income levels are not meant to be retained for long periods of time, but really should function as the first step toward transitioning to work that requires leadership experience, specialized skills, or higher levels of education. The faster people transition into better work, the tighter the low-wage market becomes. As a result, companies are pushed toward natural wage increases like those that McDonald\u2019s and Wal-Mart enacted earlier this year.\u000aThe most destructive and ironic impact of minimum wage legislation is that its negative effects disproportionately affect the people minimum wage advocates claim to help. For example, higher minimum wages do not alleviate poverty for single mothers. It actually reduces employment and hours worked for low-skilled and low-income single mothers. In fact, evidence shows that it fails for almost all groups who work at or near the minimum wage, especially the working poor, minorities, and blacks. Higher prices that result from artificially higher wages function like a value-added tax (very similar to sales tax) that is regressive, meaning a higher burden of the tax is paid by poor people. In the long-run, the costs of a higher minimum wage are evenly spread on all demographics, hurting the poor and minority communities instead of helping them out.\u000aIn Seattle, workers are asking for fewer hours in response to higher minimum wages so they can retain their welfare benefits and other forms of government aid. I remember my parents talking about losing our Medi-Cal (California\u2019s Medicaid) coverage if my mom accepted a minimum wage job while my dad claimed unemployment insurance after the recession. Excessive savings in bank accounts would have also disqualified us from Medi-Cal and prevented us from building wealth. Minimum wage increases would exacerbate the flaws in low-income insurance and welfare programs for millions of Americans, which are already serious problems. These negative effects, along with the ones listed above, would run rampant if the federal, state, or local minimum wage was raised to $15 per hour.\u000aMinimum wage work and welfare benefits have their importance, but they are not meant to adequately support a family. During my junior year of high school, both of my parents were either out of work or moving between temporary jobs. My younger brother, older sister, and I lived in a single room; my parents in another; and the master bedroom and garage were rented out to cousins and other family members. We also depended on food stamps in addition to unemployment insurance, Medi-Cal, and other forms of aid during this time. Knowing that you are dependent on someone else to provide you basic necessities is the worst feeling in the world, but it was better than moving back to my parents\u2019 hometown in Mexico. Low-wage work will not get families out of poverty, but it will provide hope and the first building blocks to earning a better standard of living.\u000aHuman creativity and ingenuity is the true way out of poverty, and my family has embraced that ever since. Over time, my dad has earned wage increases and better healthcare in response to building his skill set at work. He has also turned his love for music into extra income for my family by playing in a local band. We no longer need to rent out extra rooms, so now my sister has her own room and we enjoy extra space in the garage. My siblings and I have the opportunity to attend college at very low prices because of our low income. Using these opportunities to our advantage will help us build wealth after graduation and help our parents retire comfortably. This is how the American Dream is earned. It will never be obtained from artificial and undeserved government minimum wage increases.\u000a \u000a________________________________\u000aGraphic by Nina Kamath.\u000aShare this:Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)MoreClick to print (Opens in new window)Click to share on Pinterest (Opens in new window)Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)Click to share on Google+ (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Tags: Claremont Colleges hillary clinton los angeles Minimum Wage SeattleCategories: Opinion

aVLast fall the issue of political diversity took center stage at the Claremont Colleges as a result of two separate events. The first was the release of a 40-year study that measured the political attitudes of students and faculty at the 5Cs. The study found that over 70 percent of CMC students, and over 90 percent of students at the other colleges surveyed, identify as Democrats \u2013 a rate far above that of the American voting population. Of the 532 Claremont Colleges tenured faculty, there are only 16 registered Republicans (half of which come from CMC). The survey highlighted the glaring lack of political diversity at each school, with little to no response from any of the 5C administrations.\u000aShortly thereafter, conservative pundit George Will was disinvited from Scripps College, where he was slated to give a speech as part of the Malott Public Affairs Program. The program typically brings in one conservative speaker a year, noting that  \u201ca range of opinions about the world \u2013 especially opinions with which we may not agree, or think we do not agree \u2013 leads to a better educational experience.\u201d Will was disinvited because of a column he wrote that shared his conservative view of the college sexual assault adjudication process.\u000aThe Malott Program\u2019s failure to uphold its commitment to bring in speakers with opposing viewpoints, and the 5C administrations\u2019 lack of effort to address these concerns, sparked the formation of the Intercollegiate Studies Institute (ISI) Claremont Society. Through the ISI Claremont Society, students are able to access the ISI Speakers Bureau to bring in renowned conservative scholars to campus, connect with other ISI Society members, and attend national conferences and educational seminars.\u000aThe ISI Claremont Society\u2019s inaugural event will feature Pete Peterson, the 2014 Republican candidate for California Secretary of State and interim director of Pepperdine\u2019s School of Public Policy. The event will be held on Tuesday, September 15 at 6pm in the Athenaeum Parents Dining Room.

aS'Head Sponsor: \xe2\x80\x9cNou ap ankouraje premye ane Pa Pale ak chak l\xc3\xb2t\xe2\x80\x9d'
p751
aVYon ane nouvo lekòl se sou nou, ak sa vle di yon nouvo rekòt antye nan elèv premye ane, freshwomyn, ak tout bagay nan ant. Avèk ki vini konvèsasyon yo tipik Entwodiksyon: sa ki nan non ou, ki bò nou ye, ki sa dòtwa ou ye a, elatriye Sepandan, jiska dènyèman, nou pa t \u2018janm kritik egzamine enplikasyon yo potansyèlman ofansif nan deklarasyon sa yo.\u000aMwen panse ke tounen nan m \u2018pwòp tèt inyoran nevyèm ane de zan de sa, mache jiska moun ki mwen pa janm te kontre yo t\u2019ap di konsa bagay sa yo tankou, \u201cHey, Ki jan nan li prale? Mwen se Steven. \u201cNan moman sa a, deklarasyon sa yo te sanble inofansif-apre tout, mwen te lè l sèvi avèk kèk fòm ki fraz prezante tèt mwen ak moun pou tout lavi m \u2018. Men, sa ki mwen (ak anpil lòt freshmen, freshwomyn, ak elèv ki gen idantite pa ka adisyone moute nan yon mo sèlman) te bliye pran nan kont te lefèt ke ou pa kapab tou senpleman asime ke yon lòt elèv pale lang angle. Lè enkyetid sa a te vini nan sondaj gwoup sipòtè prentan ki sot pase a, Komite a Gwoup Sponsor fè Seyè yo dwe plis okouran de potansyèl la pou konpòtman microaggressive ki rive kòm nouvo elèv yo vini nan lakou lekòl la.\u000a\u201cNext ane, nou konte aplike kèk nouvo estrateji yo anpeche elèv ki gen premye lang se pa angle soti nan fè eksperyans sitiyasyon potansyèlman gòch a Pomona,\u201d te ekri [Non] -a direktè nan gwoup sipòtè pwogram-nan yon deklarasyon ofisyèl dènye sezon prentan an. \u201cMoun ki ap sipòte nou an ap edike elèv premye ane yo nouvo sou danje ki genyen nan an konsideran lòt timoun parèy yo vle pale yon lang sèten, epi yo pral moutre gwoup sipòtè yo pou fè pou evite kominikasyon vèbal ak lòt elèv jiskaske yo konnen lang pi pito chak elèv la nan konvèsasyon (PLC). Gwoup Sponsor pral diskite sou otomat yo nan Esperanto sou premye jou a nan oryantasyon, jis anvan ou ale sou tout moun nan Prefere Pwonon Sèks (pgp). \u201c\u000aElèv te santi ke sa a chanjman politik te yon etap nan bon direksyon an, men sa anpil pwoblèm ta toujou pèsiste. \u201cMwen byen kontan wè Pomona finalman fè yon efò diminye patipri ak lang sou lakou lekòl la,\u201d te di Kyle Johnson, PO \u201916. \u201cMen, li toujou echwe yo pran an kont elèv sa yo ki gen pwoblèm pou tande, oswa elèv ki gen enkyetid sosyal ak pa renmen dwe apwoche pa moun ki pale yo pa konnen. Mwen panse ke administrasyon an toujou gen yon anpil nan travay yo dwe fè. \u201c\u000aPandan fòmasyon sipòtè nan semèn yo anvan oryantasyon, moun ki ap sipòte yo mete tèt yo ansanm vini ak yon fason efikas elimine nenpòt rankont potansyèlman pénible. \u201cNou te panse yon aktivite bon yo ede nou réfléchir ta dwe rakonte eksperyans pwòp nou kòm elèv premye ane,\u201d te di Head Sponsor Charlie Lu, PO \u201917. \u201cSe te yon konvèsasyon vrèman difisil ak emosyonèl yo gen, men mwen panse li te vrèman benefisye. Moun te di istwa sòti nan reyinyon moun ki te soti nan eta ansyen nan Konfederasyon an, nan reyinyon elèv yo ki gen non yo te menm jan ak sa yo ki nan vyole soti nan woman yo te fòse yo li nan lekòl segondè, nan reyinyon elèv ki te planifye yo nan pi gwo nan sijè ki kapab ofansif . \u201c\u000a\u201cMwen literalman kraze kriye lè m \u2018te di istwa mwen nan lòt moun ki ap sipòte yo,\u201d te di Marissa Smith, PO \u201918. \u201cLè m \u2018te yon elèv nevyèm ane, mwen te rankontre yon moun ki moun ki te majeures nan atizay. Mwen te toujou reve nan majeures nan atizay, men paran mwen te di m \u2018yo pa ta peye Pomona nan $ 60,000 lajan pou peye lekòl sof si mwen etudye nan yon bagay\u2019 pratik \u2018tankou ekonomi oswa syans òdinatè. Mwen toujou vin malad ak vant fè mal m \u2018chak fwa mwen wè yon atis gwo mache alantou sou lakou lekòl la. \u201c\u000aNan fen a, ekip la nan moun ki ap sipòte detèmine ke, jiskaske yo te rive nan konnen sponsees yo yon ti jan pi bon epi li ka fòmile yon lis konplè nan tout bagay ki te kapab potansyèlman ofansif nan chak (ki pral dwe ekri nan yon liv pou chak premye ane a pote alantou ak pataje ak nenpòt moun yo ta ka rankontre), li ta pi bon pou nouvo elèv pou fè pou evite tout kontak youn ak lòt. \u201cVrèman, prèske nenpòt kesyon ka gen yon repons ofansif,\u201d te di Anna Rodriguez, PO \u201917, se yon Sponsor Head. \u201cSe poutèt sa, nou ap ankouraje premye ane pa pou pale ak youn ak lòt nan moman sa a.\u201d\u000a(My PLC is English, but yours may not be.

aVUn nuovo anno scolastico è alle porte, e questo significa un intero nuovo gruppo di matricole, freshwomyn, e tutto il resto. Con che arrivano le tipiche conversazioni introduttive: come ti chiami, da dove vieni, cosa dormitorio sei in, ecc, tuttavia, fino a poco tempo, non avevamo mai esaminato criticamente le implicazioni potenzialmente offensive di queste affermazioni.\u000aRipenso alla mia auto matricola ignorante, due anni fa, a piedi fino a persone che non avevo mai incontrato e dire cose come: \u201cEhi, come va? Sono Steven. \u201cAl momento, tali dichiarazioni sembrava innocuo dopo tutto, avevo usato una qualche forma di quella frase per presentarmi alla gente per tutta la mia vita. Ma quello che io (e molti altri matricole, freshwomyn, e gli studenti la cui identità non può essere riassunto in una sola parola) si era dimenticato di prendere in considerazione era il fatto che non si può semplicemente presumere che un altro studente parla inglese. Quando questa preoccupazione è venuto in studio gruppo di sponsor della scorsa primavera, il Comitato di Gruppo Sponsor ha promesso di essere più consapevoli del potenziale di comportamento microaggressive che si pone come nuovi studenti vengono a campus.\u000a\u201cIl prossimo anno, abbiamo in programma di implementare alcune nuove strategie per prevenire studenti la cui prima lingua non è inglese dallo sperimentare situazioni potenzialmente imbarazzanti a Pomona\u201d, ha scritto [Nome] -il direttore del gruppo di sponsor del programma in un comunicato ufficiale la scorsa primavera. \u201cI nostri sponsor educare le nuove matricole sui pericoli di assumere i loro coetanei vogliono parlare una certa lingua, e sarà istruire i loro gruppi di sponsor di evitare la comunicazione verbale con gli altri studenti fino a che non conoscono la lingua preferita di ogni studente di conversazione (PLC). Sponsor gruppi discuteranno i loro controllori in Esperanto, il primo giorno di orientamento, poco prima di andare su tutti è pronomi di genere preferite (PGP). \u201c\u000aGli studenti hanno ritenuto che questo cambiamento di politica è stato un passo nella giusta direzione, ma che molti problemi sarebbe ancora persistono. \u201cSono contento di vedere Pomona finalmente fare uno sforzo per ridurre i pregiudizi lingua nel campus\u201d, ha detto Kyle Johnson, PO \u201916. \u201cMa ancora non riesce a prendere in considerazione gli studenti che hanno udito difficoltà, o studenti che hanno l\u2019ansia sociale e non amano essere avvicinato da persone che non conoscono. Penso che l\u2019amministrazione ha ancora molto lavoro da fare. \u201c\u000aDurante l\u2019allenamento sponsor nelle settimane precedenti l\u2019orientamento, gli sponsor mettono insieme le loro teste a venire con un modo efficace per eliminare eventuali incontri potenzialmente dolorosi. \u201cAbbiamo pensato una buona attività per aiutarci brainstorming sarebbe raccontare le nostre esperienze come matricole\u201d, ha detto il capo Sponsor Charlie Lu, PO \u201917. \u201cE \u2018stata una conversazione molto difficile ed emozionante di avere, ma penso che sia stato davvero utile. Le persone raccontavano storie che vanno da persone che si incontrano che erano da stati precedentemente nella Confederazione, per incontrare gli studenti i cui nomi erano simili a quelli di stupratori dai romanzi erano stati costretti a leggere ad alta scuola, per incontrare gli studenti che hanno pianificato di importante in soggetti potenzialmente offensivi . \u201c\u000a\u201cHo letteralmente rotto a piangere quando ho raccontato la mia storia agli altri sponsor\u201d, ha detto Marissa Smith, PO \u201918. \u201cQuando ero una matricola, ho incontrato qualcuno che è stato laureando in arte. Avevo sempre sognato di laureando in arte, ma i miei genitori mi hanno detto che non avrebbero pagato di Pomona 60.000 $ di iscrizione a meno che non mi sono laureata in qualcosa di \u2018concreto\u2019 come economia o informatica. Ho ancora male allo stomaco ogni volta che vedo un \u2018arte importante camminare in giro nel campus. \u201c\u000aAlla fine, il team di sponsor ha stabilito che, fino a quando hanno avuto modo di conoscere i loro sponsees un po \u2018meglio e potrebbe formulare un elenco esaustivo di tutte le cose che potrebbero essere potenzialmente offensivo per ciascuno (che sarà scritto in un libro per ogni primo anno a portare in giro e condividere con chiunque che potrebbero conoscere), sarebbe meglio per i nuovi studenti per evitare ogni contatto con l\u2019altro. \u201cDavvero, quasi tutta la domanda può avere una risposta offensiva\u201d, ha detto Anna Rodriguez, PO \u201917, uno sponsor Head. \u201cPer questa ragione, stiamo incoraggiando primi anni di non parlare tra di loro in questo momento.\u201d\u000a(My PLC is English, but yours may not be.

aVEin neues Schuljahr steht vor der Tür, und das bedeutet eine ganze neue Generation von Studenten im ersten Jahr, freshwomyn, und alles dazwischen. Damit kommen die typischen einleitende Gespräche: wie heißt du, wo kommst du her, was im Studentenwohnheim sind Sie im etc. Doch bis vor kurzem, wir hatten noch nie kritisch untersucht die potenziell beleidigende Auswirkungen dieser Aussagen.\u000aIch denke zurück an meine eigene ignorant Freshman Selbst vor zwei Jahren, zu Fuß bis zu Menschen, die ich nie getroffen hatte und sagen Dinge wie: \u201cHey, wie geht es Dir? Ich bin Steven. \u201cZu der Zeit, schienen solche Aussagen harmlos immerhin hatte ich mit irgendeiner Form von dieser Phrase, mich um Leute für mein ganzes Leben einzuführen. Aber was ich (und viele andere Erstsemester, freshwomyn und Studenten, deren Identität nicht in einem bloßen Wort zusammenfassen) vergessen hatte, zu berücksichtigen, war die Tatsache, dass man nicht einfach davon ausgehen, dass ein anderer Student spricht Englisch. Wenn dieses Problem kam in Sponsor Gruppenbefragung im vergangenen Frühjahr, schwor der Sponsor Konzernausschuss mehr bewusst, das Potenzial für microaggressive Verhalten, das als neue Schüler kommen zum Campus entsteht sein.\u000a\u201cNächstes Jahr planen wir, einige neue Strategien, um Studierende, deren Muttersprache nicht Englisch ist aus erleben potenziell unangenehme Situationen in Pomona zu verhindern umzusetzen\u201d, schrieb [Name] -der Leiter des Förderkreises programm in einer offiziellen Erklärung im letzten Frühjahr. \u201cUnsere Sponsoren werden die neuen Studienanfänger über die Gefahren der Annahme, ihre Altersgenossen erziehen wollen eine bestimmte Sprache sprechen, und ihr Sponsor Gruppen anweisen, verbale Kommunikation mit anderen Schülern zu vermeiden, bis sie die gewünschte Sprache der Konversation (PLC) der einzelnen Schüler kennen. Sponsor Gruppen ihre PLCs in Esperanto am ersten Tag der Orientierung kurz vor dem über jeder ist Bevorzugte Geschlecht Pronomen (PGP) zu diskutieren. \u201c\u000aSchüler das Gefühl, dass diese Änderung der Politik war ein Schritt in die richtige Richtung, aber dass viele Probleme fortbestehen würde. \u201cIch bin froh zu sehen, Pomona schließlich darum bemühen, die Sprache Bias auf dem Campus zu reduzieren\u201d, sagte Kyle Johnson, PO \u201916. \u201cAber es immer noch nicht berücksichtigt jene Schüler, die Schwierigkeiten mit dem Hören haben, oder Studenten, die soziale Angst haben, und mag es nicht, von Menschen, die sie nicht wissen, angegangen werden zu nehmen. Ich denke, die Regierung hat immer noch eine Menge Arbeit zu tun. \u201c\u000aWährend Sponsor Ausbildung in den Wochen vor der Orientierung, legte die Sponsoren ihre Köpfe zusammen, um mit einer effektiven Weg, um alle potenziell belastend Begegnungen zu beseitigen. \u201cWir dachten, eine gute Aktivität, die uns helfen Brainstorming wäre, unseren eigenen Erfahrungen als Studienanfänger erzählen\u201d, sagte Leiter Sponsor Charlie Lu, PO \u201917. \u201cEs war eine wirklich schwierige und emotionale Konversation zu haben, aber ich glaube, es war wirklich von Vorteil. Menschen erzählten Geschichten von Begegnungen mit Menschen, die aus Staaten, die früher in der Konföderation waren, zu treffen Studenten, deren Namen ähnlich denen der Vergewaltiger aus Romanen sie gezwungen worden war, in der High School zu lesen, zu treffen Studenten, die zu den wichtigsten in potenziell beleidigend Themen geplant . \u201c\u000a\u201cIch habe buchstäblich brach weinen, als ich meine Geschichte zu den anderen Sponsoren\u201d, sagte Marissa Smith, PO \u201918. \u201cAls ich noch ein Neuling, traf ich jemanden, der in der Kunst mit Schwerpunkt wurde. Ich war immer der Schwerpunkt in der Kunst geträumt, aber meine Eltern sagten mir, sie nicht bezahlen würde Pomona $ 60.000 Studiengebühren, wenn ich an etwas \u201cpraktischen\u201d wie Wirtschaft oder Informatik studierte. Ich bekomme immer noch krank zu meinem Magen jedes Mal sehe ich eine große Kunst zu Fuß rund um auf dem Campus. \u201c\u000aLetztlich bestimmt das Team von Sponsoren, dass, bis sie bekam ihre Sponsees ein bisschen besser kennen und könnten eine erschöpfende Liste aller Dinge, die potenziell beleidigend für jeden (was in einem Buch für jeden ersten Jahr geschrieben werden könnte formulieren herumtragen und mit niemandem teilen sie sich treffen könnte), wäre es am besten für neue Studenten, alle miteinander in Kontakt zu vermeiden. \u201cWirklich, kann fast jede Frage eine offensive Antwort haben\u201d, sagte Anna Rodriguez, PO \u201917, ein Hauptsponsor. \u201cAus diesem Grund ermutigen wir ersten Jahren nicht miteinander in dieser Zeit zu sprechen.\u201d\u000a(My PLC is English, but yours may not be.

aS'Head Sponsor: \xe2\x80\x9cWe Are Encouraging First Years Not to Talk to Each Other\xe2\x80\x9d'
p779
aVA new school year is upon us, and that means a whole new crop of freshmen, freshwomyn, and everything in between. With that come the typical introductory conversations: what\u2019s your name, where are you from, what dorm are you in, etc. However, until recently, we had never critically examined the potentially offensive implications of these statements.\u000aI think back to my own ignorant freshman self two years ago, walking up to people I had never met and saying things like, \u201cHey, how\u2019s it going? I\u2019m Steven.\u201d At the time, such statements seemed harmless\u2014after all, I had been using some form of that phrase to introduce myself to people for my whole life. But what I (and many other freshmen, freshwomyn, and students whose identities cannot be summed up in a mere word) had forgotten to take into account was the fact that you cannot simply assume that another student speaks English. When this concern came up in last spring\u2019s sponsor group survey, the Sponsor Group Committee vowed to be more aware of the potential for microaggressive behavior that arises as new students come to campus.\u000a \u201cNext year, we plan to implement some new strategies to prevent students whose first language is not English from experiencing potentially awkward situations at Pomona,\u201d wrote Dean Ric Townes\u2014one of the directors of the sponsor group program\u2014in an official statement last spring. \u201cOur sponsors will educate the new first years on the dangers of assuming their peers want to speak a certain language, and will instruct their sponsor groups to avoid verbal communication with other students until they know each student\u2019s Preferred Language of Conversation (PLC). Sponsor groups will discuss their PLCs in Esperanto on the first day of orientation, just before going over everyone\u2019s Preferred Gender Pronouns (PGP).\u201d\u000a Students felt that this policy change was a step in the right direction, but that many problems would still persist. \u201cI\u2019m glad to see Pomona finally make an effort to reduce language bias on campus,\u201d said Kyle Johnson, PO \u201916. \u201cBut it still fails to take into account those students who have trouble hearing, or students who have social anxiety and don\u2019t like to be approached by people they don\u2019t know. I think the administration still has a lot of work to do.\u201d\u000a During sponsor training in the weeks before orientation, the sponsors put their heads together to come up with an effective way to eliminate any potentially distressing encounters. \u201cWe thought a good activity to help us brainstorm would be to recount our own experiences as first years,\u201d said Head Sponsor Charlie Lu, PO \u201917. \u201cIt was a really difficult and emotional conversation to have, but I think it was really beneficial. People told stories ranging from meeting people who were from states formerly in the Confederacy, to meeting students whose names were similar to those of rapists from novels with no trigger warnings, to meeting students who planned to major in potentially offensive subjects.\u201d\u000a \u201cI literally broke down crying when I told my story to the other sponsors,\u201d said Marissa Smith, PO \u201918. \u201cWhen I was a freshwomyn, I met someone who was majoring in art. I had always dreamed of majoring in art, but my parents told me they wouldn\u2019t pay Pomona\u2019s $60,000 tuition unless I majored in something \u2018practical\u2019 like economics or computer science. I still get sick to my stomach every time I see an art major walking around on campus.\u201d\u000a In the end, the team of sponsors determined that, until they got to know their sponsees a bit better and could formulate an exhaustive list of all things that could be potentially offensive to each (which will be written in a book for each first year to carry around and share with anyone they might meet), it would be best for new students to avoid all contact with each other. \u201cReally, almost any question can have an offensive answer,\u201d said Anna Rodriguez, PO \u201917, a Head Sponsor. \u201cFor that reason, we are encouraging first years not to talk to each other at this time.\u201d\u000a(My PLC is English, but yours may not be.

aS'Editorial: Welcome to the Claremont Independent'
p783
aVDear Class of 2019,\u000aCongratulations! This week you have officially entered \u201cThe Bubble.\u201d You now belong to one of the most intellectual, elite liberal arts institutions in the country\u2014where reasoned discourse and thoughtful debate are not just encouraged, but actively kept alive by your many bright and vocal peers.\u000aThe Claremont Independent is the catalyst that drives our most lively, heated student discussions. We are the leading outlet for students whose views differ from\u2014and often oppose\u2014mainstream liberals and progressives. We also report campus news and, importantly, serve as a check to 5C administrations. As the only independently funded student publication, the Claremont Independent is in a unique position to criticize administrative decisions and policies, ranging anywhere from unnecessary free speech infringements under the guise of \u201cpolitical correctness\u201d to blatantly biased curriculums that propagate liberal agendas.\u000aWe are a small but quickly growing organization with influence that extends beyond the Claremont Colleges. Last year, our stories consistently made national waves and were picked up by prominent news outlets, such as the National Review, Newsweek, and the Daily Caller. Over the summer, we received the Collegiate Network\u2019s William F. Buckley Award for Outstanding Campus Reporting.\u000aTraditionally, we have always been a right-leaning organization with the majority of our members subscribing to some variation of conservative ideology. At the heavily left-leaning Claremont Colleges, we provide students with the opposition needed to engage in critical thinking and intellectual debate\u2014two key pillars of a traditional (and meaningful!) liberal arts education.\u000a So welcome to the Claremont Independent, where you can find the most politically diverse set of opinions, thought-provoking arguments, and significant campus commentary at the 5Cs. We hope you enjoy these next four years with us.\u000aSincerely,\u000aHannah Oh\u000aEditor-in-Chief\u000a____________________________\u000aPhotography by Wes Edwards.\u000aShare this:Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)MoreClick to print (Opens in new window)Click to share on Pinterest (Opens in new window)Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)Click to share on Google+ (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Tags: Claremont Colleges Claremont Independent Conservatism Freshman Issue Hannah Oh Political DiversityCategories: Editorial

aS'Dear CMC: Stop Treating Our Social Scene like a Case Competition'
p787
aVOn August 30, the CMC administration and ASCMC announced their \u201cnew strategy of responsible moderation\u201d that will be implemented this year. In this strategy, students are given tactical guidelines for how, when, and where to socialize on campus. Framed as a way to support a \u201chealthy, inclusive, and respectful residential culture,\u201d this new strategy is the heaviest set of rules and regulations enacted at CMC to control student behavior and social interactions.\u000aFirst, I want to fully acknowledge the real and serious concerns that CMC is trying to address. No one disagrees with the administration\u2019s basic premise: all students should feel safe and act responsibly when they go out. And there is no doubt that in these past few years, high-risk alcohol and drug consumption has been a problem that has put students at risk and caused harm to our community. However, the individuals that engage in such dangerous behavior constitute a small minority of us, and the latest policy changes are a classic example of administrative overreach that infringes on CMC\u2019s most cherished freedoms.\u000aThere are a lot of things that make CMC special, but our vibrant and inclusive social scene is a point of pride that distinguishes us from every other college in the country. Unlike other schools, all of our parties are planned by our student government, rather than through an exclusive Greek system. From 6:01 to Pirate Party, everyone is invited and welcomed with open arms\u2014no matter your class year, background, or whether or not you choose to drink. It is not just our high-caliber academics and engaging courses that make us a strong community; it is our unparalleled social scene that makes everyone feel included and comfortable to be themselves. \u000aThe administration\u2019s new guidelines are highly inconsistent with CMC\u2019s character in this respect. The guidelines are divided into two parts: formal and informal activities. If students are in groups of more than 15 people and alcohol is present, they must register with the Student Activities Office at least two business days in advance. The event is limited to 30 people and must comply with the \u201cGuidelines for the Use of Alcohol at Formal Activities or Events.\u201d\u000aThe \u201cInformal Activity Guidelines\u201d focus on the day-to-day activities of students, such as gatherings in dorm rooms and residential lounges. These \u201cgatherings\u201d are limited to 15 students who are allowed to drink alcohol, as long as they are not being disruptive. Students were told that if their informal gathering grows to 16 people, they must \u201creduce the number of people at the gathering to 15 or less or the gathering will be shut down.\u201d \u000aThe problem with this policy, in particular, is that it promotes exclusivity. A gathering of 15 people or more could easily form by accident from students just hanging out in their dorm hall, friends inviting their friends, and others who walk by and feel welcomed to join. Instead of encouraging these students to intermix and mingle, the 15-person limit forces students to kick other students out of their gatherings and bar anyone new from coming in. In effect, these policies encourage negative, cliquey behavior\u2014which is antithetical to CMC\u2019s traditionally open culture.\u000aFurthermore, these \u201cinformal gatherings\u201d can only occur at designated times and spaces. They are permitted between 5:00 PM to midnight on Sunday through Thursday, and from noon to 1:00 AM on Friday and Saturday. They may only take place in residential areas, such as dorm halls, designated lounges, BBQ areas, and the Senior Apartments. (The Dean of Students created a map to clarify these parameters.) In these \u201cdesignated areas,\u201d you can carry an open, single use serving of alcohol. Outside of these areas, such as in North Quad and Parent\u2019s Field, you can carry alcohol, but only \u201cif you are headed somewhere.\u201d\u000aAs for activity regulations, beer pong is permitted in six designated spaces (north side of Beckett, Green BBQ area, Wohlford BBQ area, Claremont Hall amphitheater, Apt. 681 BBQ area, and the Wagner BBQ area south of Kramer Walkway). Other drinking games, high frequency shots, loud music, and discourteous behavior that infringe on others\u2019 right to use those spaces are violations. By designating the times, spaces, and activities for student interaction, the administration can more easily manage CMC\u2019s social scene.\u000aThis comprehensive strategy sounds like the most optimal method to minimize CMC\u2019s legal liabilities. CMC is now given full control over almost every aspect of how students interact in public spaces. The problem is that it hurts students more than it helps them by setting the most unnatural, unrealistic guidelines for students to follow.\u000aThese policies do little, if anything, to mitigate the high-risk alcohol and drug problems on campus that this strategy was intended to address. The administration has not shown any positive correlation between group sizes and levels of alcohol or drug consumption. The drinking problem is a cultural problem: if people want to drink, then they are going to drink, whether they are with 15, 30, or 100 people. These restrictive policies are more likely to encourage students to privately binge drink in their rooms and go out heavily intoxicated, so they can avoid breaking any new guidelines for carrying alcohol or drinking at unregistered events. Instead of cultivating an open, safe environment for students, or addressing the root cause of these problems, these guidelines incentivize students to engage in more dangerous behavior.\u000aThe worst part is that the administration and ASCMC are acting as if these new guidelines are actually in the best interest of students. How is it in our best interest to limit how many people we can interact with? How is it in our best interest to create exclusive guest lists? How is it in our best interest to be treated like walking liabilities, rather than human beings? \u000aWe do not need a \u201cstrategy\u201d to interact with our friends. We are not just another component of what seems like CMC\u2019s ongoing case competition to find various ways to minimize as much legal risk as possible for our institution. \u000aIt is clear that we are never going to have the same open culture and social freedoms afforded to us in years past. I, along with many other students, have come to terms with that. But for the administration to say that it is trying to create a \u201chealthy, inclusive, and respectful residential culture\u201d through its new policy is naïve at best, and disingenuous at worst. \u000aSo cut to the chase, CMC. What are you actually trying to achieve through this policy? We want your honest answers, not your calculated strategies.\u000a_______________________________\u000aImage Source: Flickr\u000aShare this:Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)MoreClick to print (Opens in new window)Click to share on Pinterest (Opens in new window)Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)Click to share on Google+ (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Tags: Claremont Colleges Claremont McKenna College Hannah Oh Hiram Chodosh Personal and Social Responsibility Responsible ModerationCategories: Editorial

aS'Five Financial Tips for Freshmen'
p791
aVWe all know that being on your own for the first time can lead to spending temptations. Whether through mismanaged bills or adventurous desires, it\u2019s very easy to overspend while in college. With new opportunities and new costs, first-year students often find themselves exceeding their allotted budgets. However, there is good news. By following these five easy tips, I can guarantee your success as a new financially responsible adult!\u000aFirst, for those who don\u2019t live within driving distance of campus, your biggest expense will be plane tickets. These can range anywhere from $100 to $500 one-way (even higher for international students). You should absolutely book all flights you plan on taking well before the semester begins. Not only will this help solidify your schedule, but it will also drastically reduce your costs. Let\u2019s say for example, that I planned on flying back to St. Louis for both Fall Break and Thanksgiving. If I booked all six of my necessary flights for the fall semester right now, my estimated cost would be around $900, but if I waited to buy the tickets until the month before each trip, I would be looking at an estimated total cost of $2,400. Therefore, by simply booking flights well in advance, you can more than halve the total cost.\u000aThe second largest expense you will incur are textbooks. For those of you who don\u2019t know, all the necessary textbooks you\u2019ll need for your classes can be found on your school\u2019s portal. My first rule for textbook purchasing is to NEVER buy them from the on-campus bookstore. You are likely receiving the highest possible price by buying them in the 5C bookstore even though they may tell you that the rental program is a bargain. The cheapest alternative is to purchase the least expensive \u201cused\u201d option on Amazon well before the semester begins. While this may be difficult to do your first semester, this policy is definitely one to adopt in the future. The Pomona College financial packet that everyone receives describing the estimated net cost of attendance lists the average textbook cost to be about $900 for the academic year. To be frank, if you\u2019re spending more than $200 a semester on textbooks, you\u2019re being ripped off and throwing away money. By simply using the ISBN numbers provided by your teacher on the portal, you will be able to buy the books you need on Amazon, or other third-party sales companies, for a fraction of the cost. If you buy used, and buy early, you will be able to drastically reduce your total textbook costs.\u000aNow that the basics have been covered, let\u2019s delve into day-to-day money-saving opportunities. First and foremost, always use all the meals you have on your meal plan before paying for meals either on or off campus\u2013remember, you have already paid for your meal plan through your room and board payment at the beginning of the year. Every meal you don\u2019t use is money thrown away. Make sure to use all of your meals and take a piece of fruit or other small item on your way out of the dining hall, which will serve as a \u201cfree\u201d snack later in the day. That way you\u2019ve made the most of your pre-paid meal plan. This may seem like simple and common sense advice, but you would be amazed how many 5C students don\u2019t fully utilize the meals they\u2019re allotted.\u000aNext, limit your off-campus meals to at most one per week. I know it\u2019s tempting to eat out frequently since the options are very enticing and the dining hall food can eventually get repetitive, but I implore you to resist. Eating out is the easiest way to see a planned budget disappear. If you allot about $10-15 per week for a meal off-campus, that sum is a very manageable monthly expense. However, even if you simply double that figure by going out twice a week, you\u2019re looking at a monthly expense of close to $100. Use the dining halls to your advantage and make going out to eat an event to remember as opposed to simply another meal. That will augment both your experience and bank account.\u000aLast but not least, keep a precise budget of your spending for the semester. Personally, I use an Excel spreadsheet to document my every cost, but I realize that\u2019s probably overkill and too tedious for most college students. With that in mind, I recommend finding one of the hundreds of budgeting apps on your phone to keep track of your expenses. Just as keeping track of everything you eat will reduce the amount you consume, the same effect applies to spending. If you get into a habit of recording all your costs, you will naturally be more mindful of your budgetary needs.\u000aThese five tips will help you manage your college spending and create good habits for life outside of academia. Don\u2019t fret if budgeting seems daunting at first. Just slowly try to implement as many of these tips as possible to reign in your costs. Using this advice, you can cut your total living expenses in half each semester and save upwards of $12,000 over the course of your undergraduate education.\u000a \u000a______________________________\u000aImage: Flickr.\u000aShare this:Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)MoreClick to print (Opens in new window)Click to share on Pinterest (Opens in new window)Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)Click to share on Google+ (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Tags: budget Claremont Colleges College costs Finance Freshman Issue jordan shaheen money spending tipsCategories: Campus News

aS'News Flash, Pomona: We\xe2\x80\x99re #1\xe2\x80\x94And That\xe2\x80\x99s a Good Thing'
p795
aVPomona College was ranked #1 in Forbes magazine\u2019s 2015 Best Colleges List, a fact that the college had proudly stated on its recently-renovated website since the ranking came out this past July. Earlier today, however, Pomona removed its Forbes ranking from the school\u2019s official website in response to a petition that made the rounds on Facebook starting yesterday. The petition, signed by 58 of Pomona\u2019s approximately 1,600 students, expressed concerns about the \u201charmful effects of college rankings\u201d on students applying to colleges.\u000aThe statement reads, \u201cPressure to attend highly ranked schools can result in stress, anxiety, and unhealthy competition among students at a time when we are most in need of support, trust, and objective information.\u201d\u000aThere are several problems with this rhetoric. First of all, most students applying to college begin their search by perusing US News and World Report, Forbes, Business Insider and other college rankings lists to get a sense for the schools that are realistic options for them given their academic credentials.  Only then do they review schools\u2019 own websites. Even though Pomona removed its ranking from its website, the ranking is still easily accessible on Forbes\u2019 website where students and their parents are likely to see it.\u000aFurther, removing the ranking from Pomona\u2019s website will not change the pressure students feel to attend highly ranked colleges.  As long as these rankings exist, students will feel compelled to try to attend a highly ranked college, as these colleges (especially those on Forbes\u2019 list) promise a higher return on students\u2019 college investment.  Given the ever rising cost of a four-year education, this is important for all students, particularly those from low-income families or those who are paying for college without parental assistance. \u000aAdditionally, the petition\u2019s concerns about a lack of objective information are completely unfounded. Forbes\u2019 rankings are based almost entirely on objective criteria: graduation rates, retention rates, graduates\u2019 salaries, and average federal student loan debt load, for example. The only subjective data Forbes uses is student evaluations from RateMyProfessor, which constitute just 7.5% of a school\u2019s ranking.\u000aThe petition goes on to state, \u201cWe encourage Pomona College to instead emphasize the many qualities which make it great and beloved\u2013its community and relationships, small and rigorous classes, commitment to access, and student research and leadership opportunities. These qualities tell the story of our college far better than a single number.\u201d\u000aOddly enough, these criteria are all entirely subjective. Nearly every US college brags on its website about its \u201ccommunity and relationships,\u201d \u201crigorous classes,\u201d and \u201cleadership opportunities.\u201d If these were the only criteria that schools presented to their prospective students, it would be impossible to distinguish any two colleges from one another. Forbes\u2014and other similar rankings\u2014use objective data to compare drastically different schools and give students the best opportunity to make a decision based on the qualities that are most important to them.\u000aStudents who don\u2019t care about rankings\u2014presumably the same students who signed the petition\u2014should not care either way about how the rankings are publicized. After all, they certainly don\u2019t take them into consideration when choosing which school to attend. But for some students\u2014and, more importantly, for many employers\u2014rankings are very important. The unfortunate truth is that despite Pomona\u2019s strong academics and high ranking, it still is not a very well known school. There is a strong possibility that potential employers will not have heard of Pomona and will need to look it up when Pomona grads apply for jobs. The first hit an employer who googles Pomona College will see is Pomona\u2019s official website. If pomona.edu lists the Forbes ranking right from the get-go, it guarantees that employers will know that Pomona is a well-respected college.\u000aPerhaps the most troubling part of this debacle is the statement that it makes. Pomona\u2019s removal of its ranking from the website is simply a statement that the school does not feel comfortable embracing its own success. Whether students are willing to admit it or not, college is competitive. Students compete to attend the best schools, schools compete to matriculate the best students, and employers compete to recruit graduates from the best colleges. In a competitive environment, not everyone can be a winner. Pomona should take pride in the fact that a major publication considers it to be the best college in America rather than giving in to the concerns of a handful of students who are worried that our objective success will negatively affect our vibrant and diverse community. There is no harm that can come of leaving the ranking online, but real harm could be done to Pomona graduates by failing to post the ranking. It is the responsibility of the college to do everything in its power to help its students succeed, and by removing the ranking from its website, Pomona has failed in that responsibility.\u000aAt Pomona, our culture assumes that anyone with a complaint has a legitimate grievance. This is simply not true, and it will be to the detriment of the school if we continue to allow anything that bothers even the tiniest fraction of our student body to be banned.\u000a_____________________________________________\u000aPhotography by Wes Edwards.\u000aShare this:Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)MoreClick to print (Opens in new window)Click to share on Pinterest (Opens in new window)Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)Click to share on Google+ (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Tags: best college forbes oxtoby petition Pomona pomona college pomona ranking rankingCategories: Campus News

aS'Coming This Fall: Changes to RDS'
p799
aVMuch like the distraught Prince Hamlet, nearly every CMC sophomore has hit an existential fork in the road: to RDS, or not to RDS? Okay, so perhaps that is overstating it, but the underlying sentiment is there. At one point or another, the thought of applying to the prestigious Robert Day Scholars (RDS) program has entered the minds of many CMC students, and the program has had an increasingly influential presence on campus. President Hiram Chodosh and Mr. Robert Day (CMC \u201965) have recently discussed ways to improve the program, which resulted in the Chodosh administration\u2019s introduction of a new \u201cRDS Amendment\u201d that will be discussed at the first CMC faculty meeting this fall.\u000aOn July 13, 2015, in a CMC faculty-wide email, President Chodosh and newly appointed Dean of Faculty Peter Uvin laid out the three goals of the RDS Amendment. First, the amendment will create an Administrative Director position to streamline the internal and external workings of the program. Michelle Chamberlain, the current RDS Director of External Relations, was temporarily appointed to this position for the summer. Second, the amendment refocuses the program\u2019s attention to CMC and other Claremont College students by allowing the program to no longer recruit MA students from outside the Claremont Colleges.\u000aThe third change is perhaps the most consequential for students (at least, directly). The amendment permits the program to \u201cadmit Robert Day Scholars at any point in their CMC academic cycle\u201d and creates more flexibility in \u201cthe design of the monetary level, the timing of the awards, and how they may be tied to the productivity of the scholars.\u201d In an interview with The Claremont Independent, Michelle Chamberlain explained that right now the scholarship is given only in a scholar\u2019s senior year. So even though scholars are selected as sophomores, they are not given their monetary award until two years later. Chamberlain suggested that the amendment could potentially create a distribution structure for how the scholarship is awarded over time. For instance, the award can be distributed in a scholar\u2019s sophomore, junior, and senior years, and some of those distributions could be tied to something concrete, like starting an enterprise or funding a research opportunity. She emphasized, however, that everything is still in flux, and this is only one potential option for how to redesign the awards.\u000aWhen asked why this third change in particular is being made, Chamberlain responded that the college is interested in making sure that the RDS program gives students the transformative experience that Mr. Day originally sought to provide. After donating $200 million\u2013\u2013one of the largest single recorded gifts in liberal arts college history\u2013\u2013to establish the RDS program in 2007, Mr. Day, the founder and former chairman of Trust Company of the West, said that he attributes much of his business success to his transformative CMC experience and that the program is his way of giving back.\u000aThe faculty committee created to work on the amendment has only met twice, and the RDS staff has only met once, so a lot more work needs to be done before any of these changes are finalized. For now, the administration has encouraged CMC professors to share their thoughts and suggestions for the amendment. Stay tuned for more updates this fall.\u000aShare this:Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)MoreClick to print (Opens in new window)Click to share on Pinterest (Opens in new window)Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)Click to share on Google+ (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Tags: Chamberlain Chodosh Economics Finance RDS Robert Day Scholar ScholarshipCategories: Campus News

aS'How Yes Can Become No'
p803
aVThis guest opinion piece was written by Nick Monco, who graduated from Claremont McKenna College (CMC) in 2006.\u000aIn addition to being a CMC alumnus and former writer for the CI, I am a Catholic priest, so I suppose it is fitting to begin this reply to Jordan Bosiljevac with a confession: when I first read snippets of her article, \u201cWhy Yes Can Mean No,\u201d it occurred to me that CMC was filling its students\u2019 heads with rubbish that I never encountered during my tenure as a student.  However, more mature and charitable reflection, and reading the article in its entirety, led me to more sympathetic thoughts. Despite the liberal sprinkling of critical theory terminology, at its core the article provided a very honest portrait of a wounded soul in a debauched culture. The labels used for the experience were different, but the experience itself mirrored in many ways the life and thought of the first man to publish a book confessing his own sins: Saint Augustine of Hippo.\u000aBefore becoming a Christian bishop, Augustine was a philosopher, an intellectual, and a party animal who would have fit in quite well at TNC. He recognized the deleterious effect that certain exterior moral forces had on his character (most notably his pagan father and mischievous friends).  Jordan points to alcohol, a culture that associates hookups only with fun, and an implied obligation when returning to someone\u2019s room as some of the external forces she encountered.  Augustine noted that his own desires (passions) and the absence of good moral teaching were internal forces that contributed to his wild ways. While Jordan does not devote as much analysis to these internal forces, she is clearly aware of them: desire, loneliness, and anxiety about future relationships and ruined friendships are explicitly mentioned.\u000aThe crux of the issue is how to frame the problem. Jordan\u2019s approach is based entirely on the idea of consent. If a person gives their full \u201cyes\u201d to something without hesitation, then it is morally acceptable.  However, when that \u201cyes\u201d comes with hesitation or is produced out of fear and anxiety, then it is really a \u201cno\u201d and what has happened is \u201crape.\u201d To get rid of \u201cyesses\u201d that mean \u201cno,\u201d we must remove the external forces that push women to give consent when they don\u2019t really mean it.\u000aThe focus on consent assumes that full consent itself makes the sexual act good.  In no other area of life is consent believed to contain such magical powers. Stuffing one\u2019s face every morning with donuts does not, by some mystical process, become healthy when one does it with full and complete consent. Investing all of one\u2019s saving without reservation in a poorly run company does not transform that decision into a financial windfall.  And yet when it comes to sex, consent takes the bad, the uncomfortable, the irresponsible, the dirty, and the dangerous and transforms them all into the good. Consent is certainly important in relation to sexual activity, but ascribing to its god-like powers only distracts us from the problems inherent in what we are consenting to.  Perhaps Jordan\u2019s real problem is not that she is only partially consenting to sex, but that she is consenting to actions that she may sense in some deep, intuitive way are not good.  The action chosen, not the act of choosing, may be the heart of the problem.\u000aThere is not space in this article to give a full and fair airing of Augustine\u2019s views on sex. However, a few salient points must be made. Although he is often portrayed as anti-sex, Augustine defended the idea that God was the creator of our sexual nature and that sex, like all creation, was good in itself.  Given our inclination to evil though, we often pursue this good thing in bad ways, for the wrong reasons, at inopportune times, with a less than ideal accomplice. Evil is never the result of loving things that are evil, but rather the result of loving a good thing more than other things that are actually better. Sexual pleasure is not evil in itself, but when it is desired more than our genuine welfare or the honor of God, our pursuit becomes sinful.\u000aOnce we recognize what we should be choosing, there is still the problem of failing to make the choice. Instead of framing the issue around rape, Augustine understood his own struggles within the context of slavery. The evil of slavery is that a person, who ought to be free to pursue happiness, is subjected to the will of another.  True freedom consists in loving the Good with our whole selves. Love unites us to what we love and produces the happiness we all desire.  Real slavery occurs when our desires drive us to do things that ultimately make us unhappy.  The greedy man robs a bank to get money and then spends the rest of his life worrying about the police. His money has come at the price of his peace. His greed has enslaved him by preventing him acquiring that which would truly satisfy his heart.\u000aAugustine was unable to discontinue the relationship with his live-in girlfriend and mother of his child, even when he became absolutely convinced that it was immoral to keep having sex with her. This dilemma inspired his famous prayer: \u201cLord, give me chastity, but not today.\u201d  It also produced this famous summary of the life of vice and virtue: \u201cTherefore the good man, although he is a [legal] slave, is free; but the bad man, even if he reigns, is a slave, and not just of one man, but\u2026of as many masters as he has vices\u201d (City of God, Book IV, Chapter 3). When we are slaves to our vices, we cannot pursue the best sort of life because we consent to acts that ultimately make us miserable. The chains that bind tightest are not worn on wrists, but on the human heart itself.\u000aWhat then would Augustine say to Jordan? First, it does no good to remove the pressure of external forces without making sure that forces at work within us \u2013 our desires, passions, ideas, and hopes \u2013 are pointing us in the right direction. Second, if we get what we think we want and lose our peace in the process, then we do not yet know what it is we truly desire. Keep looking. Third, the pursuit of happiness has been the great quest of every human being since the beginning of history. In trying to find our own happiness, we would do well to learn from others\u2019 mistakes and triumphs. Fourth, given our own obvious weaknesses, we cannot expect to free ourselves from slavery. In chapter eight of his Confessions, Augustine movingly recounts his own sudden release from servitude at the moment when he seemed most powerless against the forces binding him from within. Finally, the need for society is not only to promote consent, but to also promote choices that lead to true and lasting happiness, not for some, but for all.\u000aShare this:Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)MoreClick to print (Opens in new window)Click to share on Pinterest (Opens in new window)Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)Click to share on Google+ (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Tags: Catholicism Christianity Consent Relationships Religion SexCategories: Guest Opinion

aVBetween the George Will disinvitation at Scripps, the Allan Cunningham controversy at Harvey Mudd, and the one-sidedness of political discussions at the Claremont Colleges as a whole, it was a rough year for those who made controversial statements at the 5Cs. It is no surprise, then, that the Claremont Independent has experienced unprecedented growth this year, doubling the size of its staff to 40 writers. While CI writers used to be almost exclusively CMC students, all five schools are now represented, with the majority of our writers (56%) hailing from one of the other four Claremont Colleges.

aS'Just The Facts: Pitzer College Tuition'
p811
aVWith the current tuition increase rate at 5% per year, babies born this year (class of 2037) can expect to pay $156,671 per year\u2014$626,685 over four years\u2014for an undergraduate degree from Pitzer College. As a result, Pitzer students are left wondering, \u201cwhere does my tuition go, and why has the tuition increased?\u201d As a non-profit institution, Pitzer is not required to divulge its yearly financial audits. Fortunately, Pitzer used its discretion to post its audits from the past decade on its website. Understanding those audits can provide insight as to where the extra money is going.\u000aThe political and educational climate has changed immensely since Pitzer\u2019s founding in 1963. Federal laws that impact the finances of institutions of higher education are constantly being created and amended. For example, Title IX wasn\u2019t enacted until 1972, and the Clery Act has been amended 7 times since its inception in 1990. Additionally, more recent instances of regulation include Student Health Insurance and the Affordable Care Act. Presumably, these laws were passed with the best intentions for students attending college in America, and the debate about whether or not they are worth the costs is for a different article. This article will only seek to describe Pitzer College\u2019s budget and the effects of new regulations on the increased cost of tuition.\u000aFor a college to remain accredited and in full compliance with the law, the administration of any four-year institution is required to keep a series of records and follow various regulations regarding, for example, pay, benefits, and equal opportunity. Consequently, these record keeping and associated costs are unavoidable for any institution seeking to demonstrate compliance with federal regulations. If a college is not compliant with, say, the Clery Act, possible consequences include a suspension of the institution\u2019s Title IV funding, civil fines up to $38,500 per violation, and reputational loss due to negative media attention. Further, failure to comply with the Clery Act can be used in various litigation matters.\u000aAs new regulations are introduced, the extra paperwork and record keeping requires Pitzer to add more staff to its administration\u2014a costly change. According to a recent study by Pitzer\u2019s Institutional Research Board, Pitzer increased the size of its administration staff from 169 individuals to 217 (a 28% increase) between 2001 and 2014.\u000aAn additional factor contributing to Pitzer\u2019s increased costs is the lower student-faculty ratio. A school\u2019s student-faculty ratio is an important factor included in US News & World Report\u2019s annual rankings of American colleges. As such, since the start of the 21st century, Pitzer has worked to reduce its student-faculty ratio\u2014which includes only tenure and tenure-track faculty\u2014from 13:1 to 10:1. As the size of the student body increased with the building of new dorms (from 937 students in 2001 to 1076 in 2014, a 15% increase), the number of tenure and tenure-track faculty increased from 59 to 79, a 34% increase. The total number of faculty members (including those who are neither tenured nor tenure-track) increased by 55% from 74 in 2001 to 115 in 2014.\u000aThe exact salaries of professors and members of the administration are confidential, but data from The Chronicle of Higher Education found the tenure and tenure track salaries at Pitzer College to be $115,00 per year at the high end in 2014 . The Chronicle also reported that administrative salaries ranged from $30,000 per year for service workers to $167,000 for high-end management positions during the 2013-2014 academic year. A complete breakdown of the budget can be found in the corresponding infographic.\u000aWhile the data presented in the graphic may answer the question of, \u201cwhat does my tuition pay for?\u201d it hardly gives the reason for the increase in tuition. Various college expenses can be placed in different categories from year to year depending on a change in auditing guidelines. Part of the answer to the question of why Pitzer\u2019s tuition has nearly quadrupled in the past 35 years is that the college is \u201cnicer.\u201d In the past ten years alone, Pitzer constructed a new pool, built brand-new LEED certified dorms, a new student gym, and has turned McConnell into one of the highest-rated dining halls in the country. The \u201cPhase Two\u201d dorms cost Pitzer $33 million to complete, while the construction of the student gym and other updates to the Gold Student Center cost the college an additional $7 million. On average, each category of Pitzer\u2019s expenses has increased by 83% over the last decade, with a corresponding student revenue growth of 88%.\u000aAccording to Paul F. Campos\u2019 recent article in the New York Times, nationwide, enrollment in undergraduate, graduate, and professional programs has increased by almost 50% since 1995. Campos reported that while legislative appropriations to higher education are more than 10 times higher than they were when Pitzer was founded in the 1960s, the cost of tuition has increased by a CPI-adjusted 1,120% since 1978. It cost around $1,300 to attend a top private college in the \u201960s. Today, Pitzer charges $46,992 for full-time tuition ($61,750 including room and board) a 40% increase from $28,256 in 2003. Subsequently, Pitzer is the 15th-most expensive college in the country. Given the recent increases in spending on academic and administrative staff, along with construction projects, it appears that the 88% increase in student revenue over the last decade adds up. If the current trend continues, tuition will rise to unthinkable numbers, just as our current tuition is unfathomable to those who attended and paid for a Pitzer College education at its founding.

aS'Religion in Retreat at the 5Cs'
p815
aVIt won\u2019t shock anyone to hear that college is not a religion-friendly place. According to the McAlister Center here on campus, \u201cThe Perception on many liberal arts campuses across the country is that there is less support for the religious and spiritual identities of students and that it can be difficult for students to \u2018out\u2019 themselves as religiously identified. Students describe their experiences both in the classroom and in the social settings as often being difficult if they talk about their faith or even are identified/perceived to be of a particular faith by what they wear, how they look, or their name.\u201d\u000aPomona College\u2019s original seal.\u000aSecular institutions dominate the higher education scene, and with that comes a difficult line to walk: balancing the needs of religious students against the secular identity of the college. Some do this better than others. California State University schools \u201cderecognized\u201d the CSU Stanislaus Chi Alpha chapter, also known as the Stanislaus Christian Fellowship (a part of the InterVarsity Christian Fellowship), this past fall, denying it the free access to rooms, access to student activity programs (including student fairs), and standing across their 23 schools that every other student organization receives. The universities based the decision on the claim that InterVarsity violated school policy by requiring the group\u2019s leaders to be Christians. \u201cWhat they cannot be is faith-based where someone has to have a profession of faith to be that leader,\u201d CSUS Associate Vice President Tim Lynch told CBS Sacramento. \u201cEvery club is allowed to establish its own standards for how leaders are selected \u2013 as long as its non discriminatory \u2013 and then they are voted on by the members. Fraternities and sororities must comply with all the requirements there of but there is a gender exemption [sic throughout].\u201d\u000aBesides the obvious logical issue of how one can, well, discriminate between potential club leaders without being \u201cdiscriminatory,\u201d the fact of the matter is that religion, as a standard, is targeted. One level of categorization, gender, is acceptable but religious affiliation is not. With this outright religious discrimination by the official University administration as a context, the 5Cs look downright reverent.\u000aThe lineup of religious resources has changed significantly over the history of the 5Cs. Generally, the religious options have multiplied and diversified from a core of Christian services to what is available today. The McAlister Center provides a significant chunk of the options. It conducts Zen meditation times, Church of the Latter-Day Saints services, Quaker Friends meetings, Shabbat service and dinner, Catholic mass, and Jum\u2019ah prayer every week. There are 21other organizations on campus which offer their own services, large group meetings, lecture series, and even publications. They range from the Claremont Colleges Bahá\u2019í Club to Queers of Faith to the Muslim Student Association to Hillel to P.A.G.A.N. (Prayers About Gods and Nature) to the Soka Gakkai Budhists to the Hindu Society to the 5C Spirituality Club. All are listed on the McAlister website. Members of these groups even arrange small groups meetings that exist outside the range of the club and, of course, there are the non-school institutions like the Islamic Center of Claremont, the St. Ambrose Episcopal Church, and the Wat Bhuridattavanaram.\u000aThroughout this expansion, the 5Cs have repeatedly reaffirmed their commitment to serving the religious, as well as non-religious, students on campus. Judy Sahak, who now runs Denison Library and previously attended Scripps, told the CI in an interview that \u201c[t]here have been several occasions when the council of Presidents\u2026 or CUC\u2026 have questioned the need for the chaplains but it has prevailed.\u201d However, the official mantra of expansion and diversification has been accompanied by a distinct pressure from the 5C community for religious groups to recede from the discourse on campus in the interest of tolerance.\u000aPart of this is from the campuses\u2019 general avoidance of straightforward, possibly offensive dialogue. Minority opinions and experiences go undiscussed because it could discomfort others and the pain of accounting for all potential offense is too much trouble. This intolerance in the name of tolerance clearly cuts down discourse, particularly for students who are genuinely experiencing emotional distress on campus. Religion happens to be a topic labelled by popular campus culture as potentially offensive so issues relating to it go widely undiscussed in mixed circles. The result is a growing, but insulated religious community.\u000aMichael Stalcup, a leader of the Intervarsity chapter that serves CMC, Scripps, and Mudd (3CIV) cited the 5Cs as a remarkably safe space for religious observances compared to other institutions of higher education. But he also spoke of the changing definition and acceptability of proselytizing on campus. Stalcup rightly pointed out that \u201cproselytizing\u201d used to mean genuinely coercive forms of conversion, like offering food to a starving child only when they agree to follow your doctrine. Now, the definition has shifted to mean simply evangelizing. So policies against proselytizing, like that of the McAlister Center, mean something different today than when they were created. The distinction between rejecting religious oppression and oppressing religious discourse is a precarious one.\u000aThe intensity of secular hostility has shot up only recently. Sahak recalled that \u201cuntil about the mid-2000s, one of the [5C] chaplains came to [the Scripps] commencement and gave an invocation.\u201d This is reflective of a wider pattern across liberal arts colleges. According to the McAlister Center, \u201cThe research indicates that there is more religious bigotry and intolerance on the college campuses as well, especially in recent months.\u201d\u000aThe McAlister Center told the CI that, while \u201c[t]here are vibrant, enthusiastic, diverse religious groups and widely inclusive religious/spiritual observances ranging from a variety of religious/spiritual clubs through McAlister Center and in the greater community\u2026 there have been painful and demeaning acts and expressions of religious bigotry and prejudice on campus which reflects growing trends of anti-Semitism, Islamaphobia, and negative views of Christians, Hindus, and other religious people. The Administrations of the Colleges have been concerned and responsive to these behaviors, but this does not always resolve the fears and concerns some students are experiencing.\u201d\u000aThat being said, the 5Cs are in a much better position than most secular colleges. The McAlister Center is a powerful resource for students who are religious or want to explore existential questions. Nearly all services provided by McAlister or the 21 other organizations on the campuses are open to all comers. It\u2019s up to the community at large, students and faculty, to encourage open and honest conversation, to wear down the divide between secular and religious conversations.\u000aShare this:Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)MoreClick to print (Opens in new window)Click to share on Pinterest (Opens in new window)Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)Click to share on Google+ (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Tags: Claremont Colleges McAlister Center ReligionCategories: Campus News

aS'Invest in Oil, Help the Environment'
p819
aVThe fossil fuel divestment movement, like many other campus causes, mistakes posturing for effective action, giving its proponents a false sense of accomplishment. By divesting from fossil fuels last August, Pitzer College actually weakened its ability to help the environment. Fortunately, Pitzer\u2019s mistake can be corrected. Current market conditions allow for Pitzer to regain and extend its environmental influence (and shore up its endowment) before it is too late.\u000aPitzer\u2019s move to divest from fossil fuels came at the perfect time for the college\u2019s endowment. Either by luck or clairvoyance, the college sold its oil-related assets right before last year\u2019s major energy sector selloff. On November 27, the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) held a conference during which the cartel stated that it was not going to cut production of oil in order to retain its market share. Subsequently, oil and many other fossil fuel-related assets\u2019 prices plummeted. Halliburton\u2019s stock price fell from a high of 74.33 to 37.21, while Exxon\u2019s fell from a high of 104.76 to 82.68. Values of energy sector ETFs and mutual funds fell by 30%.\u000aThanks to a surge in domestic production due to fracking, coupled with OPEC\u2019s decision to maintain production, analysts estimate that the world is producing 1-1.5 million barrels of oil a day more than demanded. The world is even running out of space to store the excess supply. At $51 a barrel, down from $115 in June, oil is less profitable to drill. Production is slowing. As the price of oil begins to rebound, the energy sector is easing off of its 52-week lows. Halliburton is now trading at around $45, and Exxon around $86. Energy sector mutual funds have also begun to rally.\u000aNow is the time for Pitzer to reinvest in the oil industry.\u000aA shareholder\u2019s say in deciding the direction of a company is directly proportional to the number of shares it owns. Though fossil fuel divestment was a great public relations move by Pitzer, if the college intends to spark change in the oil industry, its best course of action would be, ironically, to increase the number of fossil fuel shares that it holds in its endowment portfolio. It is impossible to sell a stock without a buyer, and whoever bought Pitzer\u2019s shares probably does not care about the environmental impact of fossil fuels. At current prices, shares of companies in the energy sector are at bargain levels. By buying low, Pitzer could buy more influence for less. Pitzer\u2019s endowment would also benefit when fossil fuel prices rise in the future.\u000aIn today\u2019s market, investors are increasingly becoming catalysts for change. Just last week, General Electric finally gave into pressure from \u201cactivist\u201d investors, selling off much of its GE Capital and real estate assets. Based on a net income of $44.9 billion, Exxon Mobil is the top oil company in the United States. Its market capitalization runs $356.55 billion. In 2013, the National Association of College and University Business Officers calculated the average endowment of 849 four-year institutions in the US and Canada to be $335 million, led by Harvard ($33 Billion), Yale ($20 Billion), Princeton ($18 Billion), and Stanford ($18 Billion). Pitzer was 393rd with $118 million. The total of all college endowments in the US and Canada exceeded $455 billion, enough to buy Exxon Mobil, Valero, and Halliburton. Though colleges have enormous buying power, a complete buy-out of the companies would be unnecessary. A large minority share of ownership in the companies could be disruptive enough get their attention. A few colleges could enact real change through collaborative investment in energy, rather than divestment from it.\u000aIf not the energy sector, where to invest? Certainly not in tobacco companies, McDonald\u2019s, Coke, or Wal-Mart. Government debt supports the purchase of intercontinental ballistic missiles. What about consumer staples? Harmless, right? Proctor and Gamble (they make just about everything in your bathroom) profits off the use of fossil fuels. They still require petroleum-based products to manufacture and ship \u201cZanzibar\u201d scented deodorant to the shelves of your local CVS.\u000aWhether we like it or not, we all demand cheap energy in order to function. At the present moment, there is no cheaper energy source than fossil fuels. Beloved \u201cBig Oil\u201d will continue to drill and will remain the primary producer of transportation fuel whether or not Pitzer owns part of the industry. By divesting, Pitzer is simply ridding itself of one obvious association with fossil fuel companies. In actuality, the institution benefits enormously from fossil fuel consumption. When a professor drives to work, Pitzer benefits, just as it does when garbage is hauled away. How would Pitzer send students to Washington, D.C. to protest the Keystone pipeline, as it did last March, without oil and the 2.3 million miles of domestic energy pipelines that are already in existence?\u000aIt is my hope that cheap, efficient, renewable energy is just around the corner, and we may see it become more of a factor in our daily lives within the next few years. Many companies that are leading the charge, including the liquid metal battery company Ambri, are still in developmental stages and are privately held. This means that an institution like Pitzer cannot be a shareholder because the companies have yet to make a public equity offering. Pitzer already invests a small portion of its endowment portfolio in smaller public companies that specialize in renewable energy, limiting its exposure to them because emerging companies tend to be riskier investments. Established companies in the energy sector, including Chevron, also happen to be some of the largest researchers and providers of renewable energy. A group of investors could pressure major energy companies to do even more by allocating more capital towards renewables, causing a significant shift away from fossil fuels within the industry.\u000aThankfully, Pitzer\u2019s commitment to environmental sustainability extends beyond its bark. Pitzer\u2019s Presidential Task Force on Campus Sustainability has broad goals, including campus carbon neutrality by 2050. If the Task Force reaches just a few of its objectives, the impacts will be positive. The goals as they currently stand, however, are limited to the 34 acres of Pitzer\u2019s campus. If the Task Force proposed a collaborative investment initiative with other like-minded colleges, the consequences could resonate far beyond Pitzer\u2019s campus, adding a new dimension to what it means to be an \u201cactivist\u201d investor. Students across the 5Cs with plans for their own divestment campaigns should be mindful of the opportunity cost of spending time on a project with no environmental impact. For their cause to remain credible to non-environmentalists, they should focus on tangible accomplishments that are both symbolic and immediately effective. They should invest more, not less, in the energy sector.\u000a Disclosure: Author uses a re-usable water bottle, picks up trash in national parks, grows his own vegetables during the summer, rides his bike to work, leaves the air conditioning off, and invests in KMI, HAL, and PSX.\u000aShare this:Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)MoreClick to print (Opens in new window)Click to share on Pinterest (Opens in new window)Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)Click to share on Google+ (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Tags: Divestment Environmentalism Fossil Fuels PitzerCategories: Opinion

We wanted it to become more like us, i.e. classically liberal.\u000aThankfully, the CI has become something else entirely. Instead, it has served as a forum for discussion, a reserve of dissent, and a source of original reporting. With intellectual diversity at the Claremont Colleges so lacking and dissent from mainstream, left-wing views discouraged, it is essential that someone introduce the student body to a diverse array of different perspectives (especially those that are never heard of or ignored). Many know us as the \u201cconservative\u201d magazine; however, we see the CI as an entity that supports a free exchange of ideas for those willing to engage in the process. We have aimed to provide an intellectual space for those interested in pursuing the purpose of a liberal arts education, which is to prepare students for making the most of their time on earth through some combination of thinking and doing. We believe that the intellectual development of individuals and society occurs more through debate and discussion, rather than \u201csafe spaces\u201d and intellectual homogeneity. In other words, the CI has attempted to burst the Claremont \u201cbubble\u201d this past school year.\u000aAfter the events of this year, it is safe to say that we have succeeded. We broke the story that George Will was disinvited from a speaking engagement at Scripps College. This original piece prompted a statement from the Scripps College President calling sexual assault an issue \u201ctoo important to be trivialized in a political debate,\u201d an editorial from us, one from the Scripps Voice, and a response to the Voice\u2019s editorial. We published an opinion piece opposed to Plan B vending machines at Pomona College, which produced a series of responses varying from the less to more thoughtful (when the Voice published a similar piece two years ago it generated nary a gasp). In a move that showcased the variety of opinions in our staff, we also released piece that gave a free-market argument in favor of the vending machine. We exposed the rotten core of Scripps\u2019s Core I, infiltrated Claremont\u2019s Fight Club, discovered that CMC might as well rebrand itself as a School of Economics in a few years, and exposed issues in the appointment process for the Athenaeum\u2019s new director. One of our current associate editors, who comfortably sits on the left, bemoaned the state of the campus progressivism in what became our most successful article of the year. And, as either the ultimate sign of our success or of their desperation, the Golden Antlers wrote way too many articles about us.\u000aThis year, we also saw our staff expand to over 30 people, with members from all five colleges (yes, even Pitzer). Web traffic to the CI site more than quadrupled year-over-year. Several articles were given national attention, being featured in the likes of National Review, Newsweek, and the Washington Post.\u000aWe are happy that, considering how few conservative, libertarian, classically liberal, and centrist students there are in Claremont, we inspired and engaged in some real debates that would not have occurred otherwise. At the very least, we helped provide space for those who want to debate and to grow intellectually.\u000aNext year, expect a stronger, smarter, more engaged CI. With Hannah Oh as Editor-in-Chief and Steven Glick as Publisher, we are confident that the magazine will grow and mature into a more professional and permanent fixture of the Claremont Colleges.\u000aShare this:Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)MoreClick to print (Opens in new window)Click to share on Pinterest (Opens in new window)Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)Click to share on Google+ (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Tags: Claremont Colleges Claremont IndependentCategories: Editorial

aS'On the Athenaeum and its Director'
p827
aVI was intellectually awakened at the Athenaeum.\u000aIt all started when one of my professors spontaneously assigned an essay entitled \u201cThe Disadvantages of an Elite Education.\u201d The author of the piece was speaking at the Athenaeum later that week, and my professor wanted each of us to read the essay to encourage us to attend the lecture. When one of my classmates asked who the author was, my professor could not pronounce his name. \u201cWilliam Der-SHOE-wits \u2013 Derez-EWE-wicks \u2013 Deer-SEW-wiz,\u201d he stammered. After a few more attempts, he gave up, and we agreed simply to call him \u201cBill D.\u201d\u000aAs I read Bill D.\u2019s essay, I could feel myself changing. My heart beat rapidly, my eyes watered \u2013 it felt as if a fire had been lit in my chest. Each sentence seemed to pry my soul further and further out of the confines of my body. His words were tearing down the artificial armor that I had encased myself in over the years. I could feel the pressures of society and the market and the world begin to alleviate, as I began to see myself more clearly for who I was.\u000aLater that week, I attended Bill D.\u2019s lecture. That night, I bought his book. And over the next several weeks, I read everything that he had ever written. I have attended five of his lectures, sat-in on several writing workshops that he has hosted, and had lunch with him once. I still read one of his essays, \u201cSolitude and Leadership,\u201d which I consider his best work to date, at least once a month.\u000aOf course, I now know Bill D. as William Deresiewicz (De-REZ-awits). Deresiewicz was the first non-fiction writer whose work made me feel as if I had just been benevolently pummeled. It\u2019s an odd feeling, an almost indescribable amalgamation of joy and shame. Deresiewicz\u2019s writing often made me embarrassed about the way that I had formerly seen myself and the world. But, at the same time, I was happy to see my failures for what they were before I had made any irreversible mistakes, and I was excited about the new opportunities that lay before me to live a life that truly gave me meaning. The feeling is almost spiritual \u2013 like the out-of-body sensation of realizing that there is something out there greater than oneself; like standing on the highest mountain top and staring out at the vastness of the world; like looking up at the stars, or at a piece of art that captures something profoundly unsayable about human nature.\u000aPrior to Deresiewicz, I had only felt this sort of sensation reading the works of Jane Austen, whose characters made me ashamed of the lesser aspects of my own character, but who also served as guides to help me realize what my best possible self could look like. Although Austen was a major influence \u2013 and I have been similarly affected by the novels of Leo Tolstoy, Feodor Dostoevsky, and Henry James, in particular \u2013 something about the clarity with which Deresiewicz diagnosed my illness, undisguised by character and plot, struck me to the bone in a way that was different. Deresiewicz challenged, in plain diction, the unfounded assumptions I had made about who I was and who I wanted to be. He put in rational words the emotions that erupted within me when I read Austen, and he has helped me to recognize these feelings again and again in the works of Tolstoy and others.\u000aI am grateful that I happened to stumble upon Deresiewicz and his wonderful essays. He has irrevocably changed my life. But I also realize that it was a complete accident. Had my professor never mentioned Deresiewicz\u2019s essay, had I not attended his talk at the Athenaeum \u2013 had he never been invited to the Athenaeum in the first place \u2013 I am not sure who I would be today. That is why the Athenaeum is such an important \u2013 perhaps the most important \u2013 institution in forwarding (and reviving) the liberal arts tradition at CMC. The Athenaeum opens students up to a wide variety of ideas and perspectives that their often narrowly focused classes and specialized faculty do not. Several of my friends were not inspired by Deresiewicz like I was, and I have attended lectures that did not move me the way they moved others. You never know which speaker, which idea, is going to change your life forever. But the Athenaeum exponentially increases the chances that you will find that idea.\u000aFor this reason, the way that CMC has conducted the search for the next Athenaeum Director is troubling.\u000aFormer Athenaeum Director Bonnie Snortum stepped down from her post in 2014 after 25 years of dedicated service to the college. This past school year, the wife of CMC President Hiram Chodosh, Priya Junnar, has served as interim-director. Mrs. Junnar is now one of four finalists pursuing the full-time director position. This is not a problem in and of itself, but it requires the college to be painfully aware of the potential conflict of interest in the hiring process. The next Atheaeum Director should be chosen for her ability to perform the important duties of the position, not because of her connection to the school and its president. It is the college\u2019s duty not only to ensure that a conflict of interest is not present when choosing the next director, but that even the appearance of a conflict of interest does not discredit the ultimate decision of the hiring committee.\u000aCMC has clearly not done this. The six-person panel selected to choose the next director consists of two tenured faculty (Professors Esther Chung-Kim and Sven Arndt), two students (former ASCMC President Ben Tillotson \u201915 and Athenaeum Student Manager Hester Lam \u201815), and two administrators who report directly to President Chodosh (Director of Academic Planning Diana Graves and Vice-President for Student Affairs Jefferson Huang). If Mrs. Junnar is a finalist for the position, then administrative personnel who work directly under her husband should not be on the committee tasked with selecting the eventual director.\u000aFurthermore, at the candidate interviews (I attended three of four, including Mrs. Junnar\u2019s), I was shocked by the apparent favoritism that several students showed Mrs. Junnar over the other candidates. Several students clarified Mrs. Junnar\u2019s answers to difficult questions during her interview, and even answered the questions outright before Mrs. Junnar had the chance to answer them herself. Yet, in the other candidate interviews, these same students came across as uninterested, as if they had already made up their minds \u2013 if they even showed up at all. Even worse, during a lunch interview, one group of students spoke with the prospective candidate for about an hour, while another group of students sitting at a different table talked loudly and joked obnoxiously with each other to the point where it became difficult to hear the candidate\u2019s answers to the first group\u2019s questions. These students only came to the candidate\u2019s table in the final minutes of the interview, yet each student\u2019s evaluation of the candidate carried the same weight in the decision-making process.\u000aThe Athenaeum is too important to get this wrong. Even if Mrs. Junnar is the right candidate for the job, she has not been given the chance to demonstrate it in an impartial setting. Under these circumstances, if Mrs. Junnar is selected as the next director, then it is nothing short of a scandal \u2013 at a school that knows the word all too well.\u000aShare this:Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)MoreClick to print (Opens in new window)Click to share on Pinterest (Opens in new window)Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)Click to share on Google+ (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Tags: Athenaeum Claremont McKenna College William DeresiewiczCategories: Opinion

aS'The Flaw in \xe2\x80\x9cFlawless\xe2\x80\x9d: Beyonc\xc3\xa9 and the Contradictions in Feminism'
p831
aVSince entering Scripps, I have been told that Beyoncé, Taylor Swift, Hilary Clinton, Emma Watson, P!nk, Meghan Trainor, and Michelle Obama are feminists. I have also been told at separate times, from inside and outside of Scripps, that each of these women is anti-feminist. In class, I have watched risqué videos of women that are widely acclaimed as breakthroughs for the feminist movement, and I have watched these videos in other settings where they are viewed as over-sexualized and degrading. Because of this, I chose to contemplate and explore both the dogma and actions of each \u201cfeminist\u201d in depth. I found that these women share very little in common, leading me to believe that \u201cfeminism,\u201d as defined by the masses, lacks both consistency and a standard for accountability.\u000aI am not afraid to express the unpopular opinion that I find Beyoncé guilty of using the term \u201cfeminism\u201d (capitalistically, which is ironic for her more liberal fans) to box women into an identity that is inescapably sexual. Beyoncé is a self-proclaimed sex symbol, and sex symbols, whether male or female, do not help their respective gender\u2019s cause in terms of equality. Rather, they reduce themselves to physicality, which indubitably becomes a contest of seduction. Case in point: in her song \u201cFlawless,\u201d Beyoncé tells us that women shouldn\u2019t compete for male attention; however, in \u201cYonce\u201d she sings \u201cBoy this all for you just walk my way, Just tell me it\u2019s lookin\u2019 babe. I do this all for you babe just take aim.\u201d It would seem that even Beyoncé cannot reconcile her definition of feminism with itself. Therefore, how can we expect her message to filter down to her audience correctly? Be openly sensual for men like Beyoncé, but don\u2019t vie for male attention? That\u2019s contradictory.\u000aMany people conflate advancing freedom of expression with advancing feminism. Women can wear whatever they want, as can men, in this country. That is freedom. However, freedom of expression does not by default help the feminist cause. Maybe it did in the early twentieth century, and maybe it is still important in developing countries, but as with most social issues, modern America is addressing different challenges than other parts of the world.\u000aThere are many ways in which women can elevate themselves in society, ranging from becoming a single, strong powerhouse to being a good wife. Each has its benefits, and each is equally important. I am not going to constrain feminism by giving into a certain set of rules. What I will say, however, is that being a feminist does not require women to give men what they stereotypically want. Once women do that, they become objectified \u2013 just like Beyoncé does to herself in the \u201cFlawless\u201d music video, which features close ups of her butt and not her entire being. In these scenarios, where is the justice for a woman who is being looked at just for her body and not for the simple fact that she is a person?\u000aIt is not feminist to be desperate for male attention and then justify it by saying women desire sex, too, and that we have a right to be sexual beings. There is a difference between being sexual and selling oneself. Being a feminist is risking not getting male attention until you meet a guy who respects you. A guy who supports feminism should be in love with who a particular woman is, not how closely she reminds him of the latest Playboy magazine. In a true non-male-dominated society, a woman should never feel that, in order to get attention, she has to show off her body. And herein lies my biggest problem with Beyoncé. Beyoncé gives her audience, especially her young audience, the false idea that feminism is equivalent to sexuality. This erroneous comparison is as harmful to girls and young women as is the idea that women can\u2019t drive, work, or go to college. While many argue that in the finer details, Beyoncé clarifies the difference between feminism and sex, it is still a very fuzzy line. This distinction, if it even does exist within the Beyoncé ideology, is being missed by the majority of people in the world outside of Claremont, probably because Beyoncé sends mixed messages. For instance, while claiming that feminism requires equality of the sexes in \u201cFlawless,\u201d in \u201cBlow\u201d she says, \u201cBring your work home on top of me. I\u2019m a let you be the boss of me. I know everything you want. Give me that daddy long stroke.\u201d What do we expect 14-year-old girls to get from this? They\u2019re being taught that feminism requires them to look really sexy, put on a show of being domineering and powerful, then ultimately allow themselves to be used by men.\u000aIn this way, women have been conditioned to think it is easy to be a feminist. Just do what you want, be sexy, and defy norms. That has truth, but that is not the heart of feminism (it certainly does not describe it in its totality). The heart of feminism is taking a stand against female objectification. We are in the twenty-first century. We have to be smart. We have to think for ourselves and not give into what the media is asking of us if it is unhealthy for women at its core. Now that we have a voice, we need to make sure it is actually helping us and not feeding a patriarchal society under the guise of female liberation.\u000aYes, being a feminist is hard, and yes, advancing the feminist cause requires different actions in different eras. As modern feminists, if we want to actually help women outside of our college bubble, we have to have a more realistic idea of our audience. In the real world, it is not enough to be a woman who does whatever she wants and then call herself a feminist. We have to look at the consequences of our actions.\u000aPlease understand, I am not saying women should cover themselves from head-to-toe to be a feminist, nor am I saying that people who dress \u201cimmodestly\u201d are anti-feminist. All I am saying is that it is not enough to put on a certain outfit and say a lot of things and think it\u2019s helping women. That is rash and misguided. We need to think critically in the modern world of feminism and understand what is really helping us defy violence and oppression versus what is just further turning us into sexual objects for the world.\u000aA feminist doesn\u2019t have to cover up. A feminist doesn\u2019t have to not cover up. At its essence, feminism is supposed to look at women as people rather than sexual beings. That doesn\u2019t mean we have to be undesirable, but it doesn\u2019t mean that we have to be the epitome of sexy either. It is free of physicality. Women are people, not toys. What Beyoncé does by showing through her actions that being sexual makes women feminist is actually setting us back to a time when we were all just for sex.\u000aConsequently, we must ask ourselves: How does Scripps portray feminism? What does our Beyoncé-idolization advance for women? Why do some students feel completely unheard in their feminism classes? We need to reevaluate what we want for women in our society versus what we want to do in the moment just because it sounds revolutionary.\u000aShare this:Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)MoreClick to print (Opens in new window)Click to share on Pinterest (Opens in new window)Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)Click to share on Google+ (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Tags: Beyonce Feminism ScrippsCategories: Opinion

aS'Claremont Party Police: Social Responsibility at CMC Revisited'
p839
aVBack in October of last year, I wrote an article on social responsibility and how the CMC administration\u2019s policies that were strangling the social scene would only result in a self-fulfilling prophecy of more abusive partying.\u000aFor a while, it seemed as if things were getting better at CMC. As far as I recall, there were no major cases of unwarranted or excessive intervention during the rest of the fall semester. Maybe it was because the administration had a more laissez faire attitude towards the social scene, or maybe because students were behaving properly while hanging out with their friends \u2013 or a combination of the two.\u000aJust two weekends into this spring semester, though, students at CMC witnessed an escalation against the social scene of the kind not seen before (at least in the memory of this senior). Both The Student Life and The Forum have covered the event in recent news articles, but I still feel that some sort of analysis on that night needs to be published. This is because the emails from Dean of Students Mary Spellman and Vice President for Student Affairs, Admission & Financial Aid Jeff Huang after the event underline my belief that there is a lot of misunderstanding between the students and administration on the events of that night.\u000aThe main problem I find with the Feb. 3 email sent by Huang was the claim that RAs and Campus Security officers experienced \u201cdefiance\u201d from students who ignored multiple requests to disperse. I was in the fringes of that gathering, completely sober and, even though multiple RAs and Camp Sec officers passed within a couple feet of us, we were never told to leave the area. We saw the RAs and Camp. Sec. officers go up to the party in Green Lounge and assumed the party was being shut down, but, still, we were never asked to leave. We looked around the gathering, expecting to be told to leave, but we never saw any of the RAs or Camp. Sec. officers speak to a single individual outside or within the immediate vicinity of Green Lounge.\u000aI would assume that some part of the RAs\u2019 (not to mention, Camp. Sec.\u2019s) training is supposed to deal with dispersing a crowd, but both groups unequivocally failed to move anyone from the area. While I admittedly do not have this sort of training, it seems illogical to try to disperse a peaceful crowd by only going to a minority of belligerent individuals and telling them to leave. If one of the RAs or officers had taken the initiative to talk to any of the people outside Green Lounge, I am sure that they would have found people who would have agreed to leave (myself included). Once group after group of people left, the minority would have had to decide between fighting with the administration for the right to party by themselves or leave to follow every other partygoer.\u000aHowever, as we know, both the RAs and Camp. Sec. then made the regrettable decision to call the Claremont Police Department to disperse the crowd. This action signified the RAs\u2019 and Camp. Sec.\u2019s failure to do the basic duties of their jobs, not to mention that it was a gross overreaction to a party whose alleged failings were, according to Huang\u2019s email, a drunk \u201cpushing\u201d himself past a \u201cfemale RA\u201d and an alumnus misusing speakers to say a few profanities (a true first world anarchist if there ever was one).\u000aWhen the police arrived, they set themselves up in their SUVs and squad cars at the north edge of North Quad with their lights on with the intent of dispersing students through their passive presence. Obviously, the crowd became larger in number as students\u2019 curiosity grew with regards to why the cops were on the edge of campus. I myself waited with my friends to see what was going to happen, as we were not sure what the police would do.\u000aAs we all know, after 10-15 minutes, just as students started to get tired of waiting for something to happen, the police SUVs turned on their brights and drove onto campus telling the crowd to disperse. As students pulled out their smartphones to record this ridiculous event, a beer can was thrown in the \u201cdirection\u201d of the \u201chighest ranking\u201d police officer on the scene. I don\u2019t know who threw the can, but their act signified the general sense of frustration of the student body towards the overreactions of the administration. As I discussed above, the police did not need to be called in to a party that was, by any measure, very tame (there was not even music for a noteworthy portion of the gathering). There might have been a few individuals who were acting raucously, but that does not mean that the vast, nay overwhelming, majority of students there were posing any sort of real, violent danger towards the CMC community.\u000aBy calling the police, the RAs, Camp. Sec., and the administration lost any sort of respect that they might have once had with the student body. The majority of CMC students who went out on that Saturday had no intention of going on a destructive, anarchic spree, but they were all treated as if they were a group of vagrants. It\u2019s honestly sad to see the small amount of trust that the student body and administration had built over the last few months be thrown away so quickly. This sort of action just ties into my previous prediction of a self-fulfilling prophecy, as students will now react increasingly rebelliously towards actions of RAs, Camp. Sec., and the administration when they try to do their jobs, no matter how good their intentions are.\u000aMoving forward, I believe that the administration made a good first step by offering to communicate with students at the Feb. 9 Senate meeting (unfortunately, I was not able to attend that meeting, so I cannot speak to the specifics of what happened there). However, more will have to be done for the students to trust them again. I would recommend communicating that the administration does not condemn all students who decide to hang out with friends on a party night, just those who partake in violent acts toward other students or other members of the Claremont community. For example, I believe most students would agree that the actions of Camp. Sec. were completely justified when they shut down Rage in the Cage last semester after a student punched one of their officers. Additionally, the administration should take immediate steps to make sure that RAs and Camp. Sec. are properly trained to assess how best to disperse a crowd when they need to. From there, the administration will have to keep building the trust of students by acting reasonably during parties and only calling the police when things get truly out of hand (rioting or other types of violence that Camp. Sec. cannot control).\u000aOn a side note, I would like to ask alumni to recognize the current delicate social situation at CMC. When you come back on campus, understand that your actions will have an impact on CMC students who are currently attending this college. Please don\u2019t ruin the work that has been done to improve the social climate just because you want to have a fun night reliving your college days.\u000aThe road will be long, but, with the right leadership, I still have hope that the CMC social culture will not be ruined for future classes.\u000aShare this:Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)MoreClick to print (Opens in new window)Click to share on Pinterest (Opens in new window)Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)Click to share on Google+ (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Tags: Campus Security CMC Dean of Students Party policeCategories: Opinion

aS'Trigger Warning: Academic Freedom at Risk'
p843
aVA trigger warning is a notice at the beginning of a book, video, blog post, etc. alerting the viewer that it contains potentially discomforting material. By construction, trigger warnings are not especially problematic; in essence, trigger warnings were designed as nothing more than the internet\u2019s equivalent to a \u2018PG-13\u2019 or \u2018R\u2019 movie rating. Initially, such warnings were limited to feminist websites and aimed to protect victims of sexual assault. Over the course of the past generation or so, trigger warnings have worked their way into mainstream academia and, like many social justice initiatives on college campuses, the recent spread of trigger warnings is an example of good intentions gone bad.\u000aRecently, the student senate at UC Santa Barbara passed a resolution requiring any professor whose class analyzes \u201ccontent that may trigger the onset of symptoms of Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder\u201d to notify his or her students in advance, and permit any students who were concerned that the material would be triggering to them (whether they were diagnosed with PTSD or not) to skip the offending classes. Similarly, Oberlin College recently asked that professors remove any potentially triggering material that is not absolutely necessary for the academic goals of the class. Oberlin\u2019s guidelines strongly urged professors to make any remaining triggering material optional for the students. Oberlin\u2019s policy was later modified, but the fact that it was implemented in the first place is cause for concern.\u000aThough such policies arise from good intentions, the unfortunate truth is that they will be abused. If professors are required to allow students to omit schoolwork as they see fit, students\u2014whether victims of trauma or not\u2014will undoubtedly use the opportunity to shirk responsibility for their class participation or assignments. Additionally, any unpopular opinions\u2014whether expressed by students or professors\u2014can be deemed \u201ctriggering\u201d and, therefore, punishable by school rules, giving students a free pass to silence or ignore those they disagree with under the guise of protecting themselves from trauma.\u000aProponents of trigger warnings argue that the \u201cslippery slope\u201d argument (that is, the idea that trigger warnings could expand beyond explicit depictions of sexual violence and similarly disturbing material to include seemingly tame, everyday topics) amounts to nothing more than tomfoolery. As such, many do not consider trigger warnings a threat to academic freedom and open discourse. As it turns out, trigger warnings have already grown to include any and all material that can be triggering, which becomes particularly problematic when considered in context: after all, just about anything has the capacity to be triggering to someone. It\u2019s no surprise, then, that trigger warnings now include everything from American flags to slimy things to animals in wigs. In essence, a student could expect trigger-related accommodations from their university in response to just about anything.\u000aAs a result of the ever-growing list of triggers, the increased pressure on colleges to use trigger warnings has been detrimental to academic freedom. Many professors are unable to teach about even slightly controversial topics or share unpopular opinions for fear that their students will take action against them. Seven humanities professors wrote in a letter to Inside Higher Ed that their colleagues have received \u201cphone calls from deans and other administrators investigating student complaints that they have included \u2018triggering\u2019 material in their courses, with or without warnings.\u201d\u000aAdditionally, Brandeis professor Donald Hindley was found guilty of racial harassment in 2007 after he used the word \u201cwetback\u201d (a racial slur against Hispanics) in his class on Latin American Politics. Hindley did not direct the slur at any individual; rather, he explained the origin of the word and then went on to criticize its use\u2014all in a manner that was demonstrably relevant to the class. But to the trigger-happy administration at Brandeis, the use of that word in any context was enough to warrant punishment.\u000aFrancis Schmidt, an art professor at New Jersey\u2019s Bergen Community College, was forced to take an unpaid leave of absence and seek psychiatric help after he posted a picture of his daughter wearing a shirt that said \u201cI will take what is mine with fire & blood\u201d (a Game of Thrones reference) on his Google+ account. Administrators, seemingly too busy calling out trigger violations to keep up with current television, considered the shirt a significant enough threat to students\u2019 security to warrant punishment.\u000aPerhaps the most troubling part of academia\u2019s fixation with trigger warnings is the fact that research has shown again and again that trigger warnings do more harm than good for those who suffer from PTSD. Controlled exposure to triggering topics and images is the best treatment for PTSD, and complete avoidance of such ideas (as trigger warnings promote) can actually worsen the symptoms. Additionally, focusing on personal trauma (whether PTSD or not) as a central aspect of one\u2019s identity in daily life, which is a necessity for anybody looking for sensitivity accommodations, is linked to poor mental health. And yet, college students continue to overwhelmingly support the increased use of trigger warnings.\u000aColleges that are unconvinced by the scientific evidence and insist on using trigger warnings should ensure that any trigger warnings they deem necessary are given in the course description before students register for classes. That way, students will know in advance that there will be some discussions about sensitive topics, and they will be able to do whatever they need to mentally prepare. Students who don\u2019t think that the triggering content of the class will be a good fit for them can simply choose to take another class.\u000aIf colleges insist on keeping trigger warnings in the classroom, they must do so in a way that does not require all students to tailor their academic opportunities to fit the needs of the most sensitive person in the class. In order to maintain college classrooms\u2019 role as bastions of free speech and exchange of ideas, lectures, readings, and assignments cannot be made optional to students in order to avoid distress. There\u2019s an important line to be drawn between notifying students before they learn about a touchy subject and censoring substantial portions of a class\u2019s content.\u000aShare this:Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)MoreClick to print (Opens in new window)Click to share on Pinterest (Opens in new window)Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)Click to share on Google+ (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Tags: College PTSD trigger warningCategories: Opinion

aVHarvey Mudd College hosted local, Los Angeles-based comedian Allan Cunningham Feb. 4 for the weekly Wednesday Nighter. The Wednesday Nighter is meant to be a break from the perpetual study grind that consumes most Mudders. Past events have included DUCK improv comedy shows, the 5C ballroom dance team, and a number of student talent showcases. On this particular Wednesday night the crowd was much larger than usual, and everyone had come out expecting to get a good laugh. Unfortunately, the night of comedy did not go as planned.\u000aThe comedian was clearly struggling to get started, opening the show by just talking to the audience for a little bit and making a joke about how ugly the curtains in Platt were. After bumbling for a few more minutes, he announced to the crowd that he was having trouble transitioning into a set because the college had asked him to keep his act clean. He then proceeded into the set of jokes that he had prepared for the night. After around 15 minutes, a student who was offended by some of the material interrupted him. The comedian then got into an argument with this student and, subsequently, was asked to leave by a proctor.\u000aAfterward, the student body received an email from members of the DOS staff apologizing for exposing the students present at the Wednesday Nighter to the \u201cupsetting and offensive\u201d ideas in the act. Dorm proctors also sent out emails to encourage those who found the jokes offensive to come talk to them and to reassure their dorm mates that these ideas have no place at Harvey Mudd College.\u000aThe incident as a whole sparked a discussion across campus about whether Mudd should be sheltering its students from ideas that may be offensive to certain groups. As time went on, the discussion developed into the wider question of whether or not Mudd, and the rest of the Claremont Colleges, should be sheltering students from ideas that might be offensive.\u000aThe reality is that these offensive ideas do exist, and there is a high probability that all of the students at the Claremont Colleges will run into them at some point during their lives and professional careers. College is a place where students are supposed to expose themselves to as many different ideas as possible so that they can create their own set of beliefs, not just inherit that of their parents. When colleges regulate the viewpoints that are allowed on campus, they begin to mold beliefs for their students, rather than allowing each individual to form their own. Some might argue that everyone having the same belief set is a good thing, but, to me, that sounds like the foundation of an Orwellian society. So, while I do not believe that the colleges should be seeking out and intentionally exposing their students to offensive ideas, they should not shelter students from these beliefs either.\u000aThe idea that \u201coffensive\u201d beliefs are not welcome on campus is a troubling notion when it relates to free speech. The fact that each of the Claremont Colleges promotes diversity within their campuses means that admitted students will inevitably bring with them a wide variety of upbringings and core values that might be offensive to other students. This is just a fact of life, regardless of what side of the political spectrum one sits on; we cannot all agree on everything. So, if \u201coffensive\u201d ideas are not allowed on the campuses, what are we to do about beliefs that might offend other students? Even the most progressive of student have beliefs that others students, particularly those on the other end of the political spectrum, will find offensive. The worrying thing is that, with the kind of thinking presented in the emails Mudd students received after this incident, it seems as if the PC culture on campus is trying to prevent any ideas that might be offensive to other students from being brought up. Is a PC culture this strict worth limiting free speech on campus?\u000aI can only guess that, after this debacle, it will be a substantial amount of time before Mudd brings another professional comedian to its campus. In the meantime, we should ask ourselves if being sheltered from outside ideas is actually the best thing for our development into life after university.\u000aShare this:Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)MoreClick to print (Opens in new window)Click to share on Pinterest (Opens in new window)Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)Click to share on Google+ (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Tags: comedy harvey mudd college PC cultureCategories: Opinion

aS'Why Malott Matters'
p851
aVSince 2005, a committee composed of several faculty members, alumnae, and students has met every spring to begin work on selecting a conservative speaker to invite to Scripps for the following year. All of this is made possible by the generosity and drive of Elizabeth Hubert Malott (Class of 1953 and Trustee from 1996-2003). Mrs. Hubert Malott cherished her time at Scripps and valued above all else the new ideas, philosophies, and horizons that she was exposed to during her four years at the college. According to her daughter, Liza Malott Pohle, Mrs. Malott\u2019s vision for the conservative speaker series was, \u201cfacilitating informed debate, inspiring curiosity and intellectual inquiry, and offering students opportunities to explore topics of national and international interest with visiting speakers offering conservative points of view.\u201d\u000aThe committee meticulously plans a rigorous schedule of events for each guest to participate in while spending time at Scripps and the other 5Cs. The Malott series is unique among college speaker programs because it engages each guest in a full day of activities and functions: the honored speaker takes a full tour of the campus and engages in a small group discussion with hand-selected students who are familiar with the speaker\u2019s work. Additionally, the speaker gives a public address in the evening and then attends a reception dinner with student leaders. Previous speakers in the series have included political strategist Mary Matalin (2006), New York Times columnist David Brooks (2011), actor, writer, and conservative pundit Ben Stein (2012), and world-renowned syndicated columnist and author Charles Krauthammer (2013). Peggy Noonan, a conservative speechwriter under the Reagan administration, spoke last year. The speakers consistently walk away from their experiences on campus impressed and hopeful for the future of our undergraduates. For the past few years, the Malott Public Affairs Program has focused on bringing young women to campus in an effort to further inspire the Scripps community from a conservative perspective.\u000aThe importance of such a campus speaker series as the Elizabeth Hubert Malott Public Affairs Program has never been clearer. As student bodies across the United States become progressively more liberal with every passing admissions cycle, it is crucial that active conservative pundits, be they journalists, politicians, authors, or strategists, continue to make appearances on campuses. They offer a perspective and experience that differs dramatically from the ubiquitous liberal dialogue of the American higher education system. A 2012 poll showed that only 10 percent of college professors identified as conservative (and this number is dropping) and 0.4 percent identified as \u201cfar right.\u201d By contrast, 50 percent of college professors identified as liberal and 15 percent identified as \u201cfar left.\u201d With a clear lack of conservative thought taught at colleges today\u2014let alone small liberal arts colleges in Southern California\u2014there has never been a more important time for students to be educated across party lines. Even if the students in question ultimately decide to disagree with the opinions of the speakers, it is important that students have an opportunity to hear all sides of the story directly from the source\u2014which too often they do not.\u000aDuring my time at Scripps so far, I have been exposed almost exclusively to points of view that range from leftist to so leftist that they make Southern California look conservative. I have only been assigned readings by Ward Churchill, Amy Hollywood, Angela Davis, Howard Zinn, and others like them. There is hardly room for Alexis de Tocqueville, let alone Russell Kirk and Ayn Rand. In my introductory classes, I am not only expected to align with the extremely liberal views of all of my Professors, but also to go about defending these views furiously in written assignments, lest I be graded down for complacency. My experience with Core I is a good example of a course where the extremely linear dialogue taught by my professor offered no space for disagreement from students. I maintain that, though it masquerades in the course catalogue as a class that teaches \u201ccritical thinking,\u201d in reality it is anything but that. This semester, I am having a somewhat similar experience in my seminar class on Gender and Religion at Pomona. The extremely \u2018academic\u2019 dialogue I\u2019ve been offered provides notions about gender as we know it being entirely molded by society, and the \u2018West\u2019 acting as the ultimate evil colonizer of the world. There is no room for disagreement with the likes of the renowned Feminist, Gender, and Sexuality Studies scholars within the world of modern day academia.\u000aAlthough at times the institution-wide attack on conservatism (in class, in guest-lectures, in the divestment movements across all the campuses) that I have experienced since beginning college has been hostile and disheartening, in reality it has encouraged me to strengthen my own depth of knowledge with regard to my personal beliefs. For all of my beliefs that fall toward a more centrist, or leftist political stance, I am applauded and encouraged. For my other opinions, I have been given the really unique opportunity to think about them more critically than I ever have before. As someone who has lived her entire life aware of the conservative political perspective and some of what it might entail, when I walk out of classes I know that there is always another side of the story worth pursuing. Only after hearing every available perspective do I feel informed enough to formulate an opinion of my own\u2014surprise, most days I am still a conservative. My point, however, is that as young minds we are entitled to the autonomy that is required to decipher for ourselves our own opinions\u2014something that Claremont takes away from us by presenting only one half of the available dialogue.\u000aUltimately, the problem with having such a one-sided academic environment on our campuses is that students, whether liberal, conservative, or anywhere in the middle are simply not being given the full story on any political matter. I implore liberal-minded students to attend Mrs. Bush\u2019s talk to listen to opinions that differ from their own. Political discussion and debate are an integral part of any classroom environment. But first, students must be at least somewhat informed about both perspectives. By way of the Malott Speaker Series, Scripps presents the conservative side of the debate to the public. It is undoubtedly a valuable experience\u2014every now and again\u2014to hear an eloquently articulated opinion that is not your own, in an effort to stay as fully informed and cognizant as possible.\u000aShare this:Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)MoreClick to print (Opens in new window)Click to share on Pinterest (Opens in new window)Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)Click to share on Google+ (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Tags: malott progressive ScrippsCategories: Opinion

aS'We Shall Remain'
p859
aVLast winter, I had the privilege of returning to Israel for the first time in over five years. During the trip, my group paid a visit to Yad Vashem, Israel\u2019s national Holocaust museum. As we entered the museum, we zigzagged around the story of European anti-Semitism, how Hitler acquired his influence, got into power, and slowly carried out genocide against eleven million people. We saw how society stood by quietly as the Nazis rampaged through Europe, and how it failed to stop the round up of Jews from the mass graves of Babi Yar to the death camps of Treblinka. It served as a warning against silence in the face of bigotry.\u000aToday, I walk around campus vigilantly, worried that I will face scrutiny or attacks for my beliefs. Recently, anonymous students targeted Claremont Students for Israel, a pro-Israel campus group over which I preside, via Yik Yak. When I was informed of the commentary spewing around Yik Yak, including: \u201cit was time to fire up the ovens\u201d and \u201cHeil Hitler,\u201d I instantly had flashbacks to the imagery I saw at Yad Vashem. I closed my eyes and saw the abandoned shoes of the nameless victims of state-sponsored genocide. I saw the scrolls of the Torah destroyed and desecrated. I recalled the photographs of my people heaped in a mass grave as soldiers shot them in the head. But here I was, in Claremont of all places, experiencing the same gut-wrenching feelings that I did in a Holocaust museum.\u000aThis is not the only instance of anti-Zionist and/or anti-Semitic bigotry I have seen over the course of my four years in Claremont. Earlier this year, three mezuzot were ripped off the doorposts of proud Jewish men at Claremont McKenna College. During the Martin Luther King, Jr. Commemoration night at Garrison Theater, we heard Marc Lamont Hill refer to Israel as an \u201capartheid state,\u201d one of the most factually inaccurate and libelous charges against the Jewish state. The Student Life included a problematic article in its news section calling for the anti-Israel Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions movement, which holds a double-standard against Israel rather than condemning the rest of the Arab world for oppressing Palestinian-Arabs. Claremont Students for Israel had event flyers ripped off from buildings across campus. Finally, we have people posting anti-Semitic comments on Yik Yak.\u000aAnti-Semitism takes various forms. Unfortunately, this includes rhetoric from people who criticize the State of Israel who cross the line and foment anti-Semitic commentary. As President of Claremont Students for Israel, I cannot help but notice the connections between rising levels of Israel hatred and rising levels of anti-Semitism over the past decade. The metastasis of this anti-Semitic cancer in Claremont started with an Israeli flag being ripped from a windowsill. An anti-Israel divestment resolution was passed at UC Davis, and the Jewish fraternity had swastikas on their house two days later. At Northeastern University, Students for Justice in Palestine hijacked a Holocaust commemoration event waving a PLO flag chanting the genocidal chant, \u201cFrom the River to the Sea, Palestine will be free.\u201d SJP chapters have also been known for posting Nazi-era cartoons directed toward the Jewish state. It does not surprise me that after my group\u2019s flyers were ripped down from the Hoch-Shanahan dining hall, we had to hear Nazi sympathizing comments and anti-Jewish rhetoric from either trolls or Jew-hating cowards hiding behind Yik Yak. Whether or not the administrations or the student body wants to admit it, Claremont faces an anti-Semitism problem.\u000aClaremont cannot stand silent on this issue anymore. As Yom HaShoah approaches, the Jewish community will honor the six million Jewish lives brutally lost under the Nazi\u2019s regime once more. Over that period of time, I expect the Jewish community to put aside their differences and unite to make a statement against anti-Semitism and against unreasonable bigotry. During that time, we cannot, and we should not, allow these anti-Semitic events to instill fear. We should not allow people and/or organizations to hijack the Jewish community\u2019s attempts to live peacefully in a diverse college environment without facing hatred. Messages of peace, love, and unity should not be met with calls for separation, violence, and hatred. This is something that our entire community should theoretically stand with us on. I hope to see us all there.\u000aShare this:Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)MoreClick to print (Opens in new window)Click to share on Pinterest (Opens in new window)Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)Click to share on Google+ (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Tags: Anti-Semitism Anti-Zionism Claremont Students for Israel Divestment Israel Jewish Students Students for Justice in Palestine Yik YakCategories: Opinion

aVIn a recent issue of The Student Life, we came across a funny little name for CI articles that ruffle campus progressives\u2019 feathers: \u201cThat One Article.\u201d\u000aSome would see a problem. We see an opportunity. As a long-ignored voice on campus, it is great to see others acknowledging our efforts to challenge progressives\u2019 control of the campus debate this year.\u000aBut, why, some might ask, is it even beneficial that we exist and grow as a publication? Simply put, we are showing a different way forward for those who are unhappy with the mainstream campus debate on both on- and off-campus issues. Instead of basing ourselves on intolerant \u201cinclusiveness\u201d and censorious \u201csafety,\u201d we believe in the fundamental importance of individual rights, and the principles that are the basis of Western civilization.\u000aOne of these rights is due process, including the presumption of \u201cinnocent until proven guilty.\u201d Sadly, such a right does not mix well with the impulses of campus activists. In the case of the Ferguson shooting of last year, students marched out against what they assumed was the racist murder of an innocent man before the facts were out. While some might argue that the justice system is inherently racist, the Justice Department\u2019s recent report supporting the decision of the grand jury should at least give activists pause.\u000aAmerica is still infected with racism, but that fact should, if anything, make us want to strengthen individual rights, rather than abrogate or infringe on them. Instead of immediately resorting to ill-founded assumptions and angry rhetoric, we urge students across the political spectrum to take a step back. Listen to and understand your fellow Americans. Get to know your fellow human beings as individuals with hopes, dreams, and fears, not as caricatures that are labelled by any number of hateful adjectives. This goes for both conservatives and progressives.\u000aWe believe that you have the right to speak your piece whether or not we agree with you, regardless of what some students might say. Case in point, over the past year, a number of centrist and self-identified liberal students have joined our staff because they felt there was not enough room for their views in the mainstream campus debate.\u000aIn a campus that is so obsessed with tearing down the \u201cestablishment,\u201d we will continue to build up those who do not conform to the established view on campus. The CI is at its strongest in years, and we are eager to grow further and challenge more of the comfortable conformity that attracts well-intentioned progressives. While it is central to our conservative principles that everyone be safe from physical harm, no idea should be safe or privileged from discussion and debate.\u000aWe are the publication that must not be named, and we are here to stay.\u000aPhoto Credit: Wikimedia Commons\u000aShare this:Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)MoreClick to print (Opens in new window)Click to share on Pinterest (Opens in new window)Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)Click to share on Google+ (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Tags: Claremont Independent conservative progressive The Student LifeCategories: Editorial

aVBarbara Pierce Bush, a global health activist, social justice champion, and daughter of President George W. Bush, headlined the 2015 Elizabeth Hubert Malott Public Affairs Program March 24 at Scripps College\u2019s Garrison Theater.\u000aThe Malott program has sought to bring speakers to campus who hold \u201ca range of opinions about the world \u2013 especially opinions with which we may not agree, or think we do not agree.\u201d The last three guest lectureships were given by syndicated conservative columnists Charles Krauthammer, Peggy Noonan, and George Will.\u000aAccording to an unnamed source within the Scripps administration, the Bush talk this year was such a success, that the college is planning to alter the mission statement of the Malott Program for future lectures. The new goal of the speaker series will reportedly be to bring speakers to campus who are \u201cthe close relatives of those with a range of opinions about the world \u2013 especially opinions with which we may not agree, or think we do not agree.\u201d\u000a\u201cRather than expanding the intellectual horizons of Scripps students by inviting speakers to challenge their widely held, preconceived political notions, as the program has done in previous years, the new Malott Public Affairs Program will try to teach Scripps students how to cope with their conservative family members by inviting the close relations of prominent conservatives to speak on campus,\u201d Scripps President Lori Bettison-Varga said in an internal memo obtained by the Independent. \u201cI cannot think of a more exemplary inaugural speaker for the new direction of the Malott speaker series than Barbara Pierce Bush, daughter of that racist George W. Bush.\u201d\u000aSeveral members of the Scripps administration told the Independent that they support the decision to take the Malott speaker series in a new direction.\u000a\u201cI think the change to the Malott program is a step in the right direction,\u201d Women\u2019s Studies Chair Rosie Theriveter-Steinem said in an interview with the Independent. \u201cRather than introducing Scripps students to conservative principles and ideology \u2013 in order to force them to think about their own beliefs in a more critical light \u2013 I think it\u2019s more important that Scripps students understand how to grapple mentally and emotionally with the fact that they have conservative family members.\u201d\u000a\u201cAfter all, what\u2019s the point of bringing conservatives to campus when students already won\u2019t take them seriously?\u201d Scripps Vice President for Social Deconstruction Betty Wolf-Woolf-Wollstonecraft-Dunham said in an interview with the Independent. \u201cI mean, I really don\u2019t think it would create an effective dialogue, anyway, because most students would be too upset even to listen, so why bother?\u201d\u000a\u201cEven thinking that there\u2019s a conservative in close proximity \u2013 or that people with such beliefs actually exist \u2013 is pretty triggering to most students at Scripps,\u201d one cousellor at Monsour Counselling and Psychological Services told the Independent in an email. \u201cBut we can learn a lot about how to cope with that trauma from those who actually had to live under the same roof as one.\u201d\u000aThe Independent also obtained a list of potential candidates that the Scripps administration plans to invite for the Malott speaker series in upcoming years.

aS'Why We Still Need Harry Jaffa'
p871
aVEarlier this year, Claremont McKenna College lost perhaps the most famous professor ever to teach under the Bauer Center rotunda. Harry Jaffa was 96, but still just as cantankerous as when he first came to Claremont in 1965.\u000aBefore arriving at what was then Claremont Men\u2019s College, Jaffa beat long odds to secure positions at the University of Chicago and Ohio State University when universities weren\u2019t hiring Jews. Jaffa\u2019s mentor at Yale, Harvey Mansfield Sr., even tried to dissuade him from going into academia, despite his brilliance, because of the slim job prospects that awaited him there \u2013 but that only made Jaffa more resolved than ever on becoming a professor.\u000aAnd it was his professors whom Jaffa looked up to more than anyone. After fleeing Yale to continue his graduate studies at the New School, Jaffa took a class with Leo Strauss, a Jewish émigré from Germany and one of Hitler\u2019s gifts to America. Over seven years and a mutual relocation to the University of Chicago, Jaffa took 19 courses with Strauss. Guiding him on journeys through the greatest books ever written and the most profound thoughts ever speculated upon, Strauss freed Jaffa\u2019s mind and showed him that there was more to life than the shadows on the cave wall.\u000a\u201cOne of Strauss\u2019s secrets was that he made you feel not a passive receptacle of his insights, but as his partner in the voyage of discovery. He was the captain of the ship. But you were part of the crew. And you sailed together,\u201d Jaffa writes.\u000aAt Ohio State University, Jaffa wrote his magnum opus, Crisis of the House Divided, an interpretation of the Lincoln-Douglas Debates. At the time of its publication in 1959, America\u2019s perception of its greatest president had changed drastically. At best, as a new brand of scientific historicism proclaimed, Lincoln was an incompetent leader who fought an unnecessary war that more tactful diplomacy could have prevented. At worst, as many even on the Right thought, he was a power-hungry tyrant.\u000aJaffa\u2019s book changed the way we think about Lincoln. He showed that Lincoln and Douglas were not simply talking about slavery or popular sovereignty, but they were having the same debate that Socrates and Thrasymachus had over 2,000 years prior in Plato\u2019s Republic. Thrasymachus\u2019 position is that justice is simply the will of the stronger (Douglas\u2019 popular sovereignty), whereas Socrates argues that right and wrong are truths discernible by reason, independent of what the stronger says they are (Lincoln\u2019s view that slavery is always immoral, even if the people want it). This is why Lincoln held the Declaration of Independence \u2013 a document that proclaims it a self-evident truth that man is endowed by his Creator with unalienable rights to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness \u2013 in such high esteem, even above the Constitution.\u000aPart of Douglas\u2019 principle of popular sovereignty is that, as an Illinoisan, he has no right to say whether slavery is good or evil to someone living in another state, where the economy, customs, and even morals are supposedly different. The Founders, he argues, understood this and, therefore, implemented a federalist system of self-government and state\u2019s rights in order to ensure that no one state\u2019s view of morality overthrows the rest.\u000aDouglas essentially tells Lincoln that he has no right to judge the institution of slavery in the states of which he is not a citizen. Who is Lincoln to say whether slavery is right or wrong to someone living in a culture of which he is not a part and that he fundamentally does not understand? To do so is the pinnacle of both arrogance and ignorance.\u000aA similar sort of argument is in vogue on college campuses today. When a white student tries to speak on issues pertaining to race, or a cisgender student tries to comment on political questions relating to transgenderism, they are told that they cannot possibly understand the issues because of their identities and privileged statuses. These students are told that their opinions are not warranted and would be better kept to themselves (i.e., shut up). Substitute \u201cwhite\u201d or \u201ccisgendered\u201d for \u201cIllinoisan,\u201d and this is the same argument that Douglas makes against Lincoln.\u000aWould those who champion identity politics really extend such a morally pusillanimous and intellectually feeble principle to the institution of slavery or to other human atrocities? Should one not denounce slavery in Georgia because he is not from Georgia, or the Holocaust as evil because he is not German? It seems that such a view is only invoked when it is politically advantageous to do so.\u000aOne of the enduring lessons of Jaffa is that moral truth is not simply a zeitgeist of the peculiar times in which we live, the background we come from, or the identities we hold. Moral truth is accessible to everyone, everywhere, because it is connected to a permanent view of human nature discernible through reason. Therefore, as Jaffa might have posited, it is irrational to claim that someone cannot understand political questions regarding race, gender, or sexuality just because he does not hold a certain identity. It is not one\u2019s identity as black or white or straight or gay that gives one authority to comment on these questions, but one\u2019s capacity to reason as a human being that does.\u000aThis is not to say that one\u2019s judgment cannot become clouded by bias. Everyone holds certain prejudices that are a product of the environment in which they grow up and live. Further, just because moral truth is accessible through reason does not mean that reason is infallible. But without proper evidence to show that one has succumbed to bigoted proclivities or made an erroneous judgment, it is unreasonable to assume that a white person cannot make a contribution to dialogues centered on race, or straight people to discussions of homosexuality, because these questions are essentially different versions of the same debates \u2013 those over justice, good, evil, and human nature \u2013 that have been raging throughout history.\u000aSo, just remember, if anyone tells you that you cannot talk about certain subjects because you do not hold an identity authorized to do so, tell them to read the great Harry Jaffa, because they are beginning to sound an awful lot like Stephen Douglas.\u000aShare this:Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)MoreClick to print (Opens in new window)Click to share on Pinterest (Opens in new window)Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)Click to share on Google+ (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Tags: abraham lincoln claremont CMC harry jaffa stephen douglasCategories: Opinion

aVThe CMC site of the student-run Volunteer Income Tax Assistance (VITA) program, sponsored by the IRS, began operations last spring, and in the year of its inception filed 60 tax returns and helped community members refund a total of $46,000. The group is composed entirely of volunteers who have committed their time to learning the tax preparation material and assisting members of the community. Every Saturday starting on February 7th, VITA will offer walk-in services from 9:00AM-12:00PM to anyone whose annual gross income is less than $53,000, double for couples filing jointly. Exact dates, times, and locations are listed below.\u000a2015 VITA Walk-In Dates, Times, and Locations\u000aSaturday, February 21, 2015\u000a9:00 AM \u2013 12:00 PM\u000aKRV Kravis Center 164\u000aSaturday, February 28, 2015\u000a9:00 AM \u2013 12:00 PM\u000aKRV Kravis Center 164\u000aSaturday, March 07, 2015\u000a9:00 AM \u2013 12:00 PM\u000aRN Roberts North 15\u000aSaturday, March 28, 2015\u000a9:00 AM \u2013 12:00 PM\u000aKRV Kravis Center 164\u000aSaturday, April 04, 2015\u000a9:00 AM \u2013 12:00 PM\u000aKRV Kravis Center 164\u000aSaturday, April 11, 2015\u000a9:00 AM \u2013 12:00 PM\u000aKRV Kravis Center 165\u000aWhen coming in to get your tax return(s) filed, please bring the following items:

aVWhat you already know (or suspect) about Computer Science:\u000a Virtually all of us understand the value of computer science. Its practicality in the job market is constantly making headlines. We are told that being a software developer is the best gig in tech[1]. We are bombarded with figures from the federal labor bureau telling us that programmers are wealthy and the tech industry is booming[2]. We read that developers enjoy their jobs[3]. We might expect that at a school constantly boasting about being the happiest college in America, we would be self-selecting for the \u2018happiest job in America\u2019[4].\u000aBut we\u2019re not.\u000aAccording to Claremont McKenna College\u2019s (CMC) common data set, last year only 1.66% of the graduating class majored in computer science (CS)[5]. According to our Computer Science Department, less than 5%[6] of the class of 2015 will graduate either as a CS major, or with a sequence in computer science.\u000aNow, you might argue that CMCers are inherently not interested in computer science. 67%[7] of our recent graduates land somewhere in the trifecta of consulting, finance and government; the majority of us aren\u2019t looking to be programmers. But when polled, CMCers unanimously agreed that computer science seems like an important topic, and 92.3% of students said they were interested in taking a class[8].

aVBy now, you have doubtless heard every analy­sis of the Charlie Hebdo tragedy. As we at the Inde­pendent saw our social media feeds flood with support for the \u201cJe Suis Charlie\u201d movement, we realized that \u201cCharlies\u201d are often the same people who chide the CI and others for publishing articles that don\u2019t line up with the progressive, politically correct agenda. Sud­denly, everyone was a champion of free speech and the values of liberal democracy, but no one seemed to know what that means. \u000aCitizens of Western democracies, especially of the progressive or social democrat variety, must come to terms with reality. They have taken freedom, including, but not limited to, freedom of speech, for granted, and rarely appreciate its import.\u000aIn 2014, for the ninth consecutive year, accord­ing to Freedom House, the tide of freedom retreated around the world. Last year, nearly twice as many countries saw declines in freedom as saw improvements. About as many peo­ple live in \u201cfree\u201d countries (2.9 billion) as in those that are \u201cnot free\u201d (2.6 billion). No continent, no region is immune from il­liberalism. \u000aWhile the Charlie Hebdo killings hit close to home, similar and far worse tragedies are being orchestrated daily across the globe. For example, in Pakistan, a pregnant Farzana Paveen was stoned to death by her father, brother, and her spurned cousin-fi­ance because she chose to marry a man she loved. She was just one among the hundreds, if not thousands, of women killed in the name of honor in Pakistan every year. Raif Badawi, a blog­ger in Saudi Arabia, faces 1,000 lashes and 10 years in prison for allegedly \u201cinsulting Islam\u201d on his blog, \u201cFree Saudi Liber­als.\u201d Among its countless acts of barbarism, ISIS is throwing gay men out of buildings, stoning women, and crucifying young men who refuse to convert to Sunni Islam. The abridgement of freedom is not in any way limited to Muslim-majority nations. In Nigeria, Boko Haram (\u201cWestern Education is Forbidden\u201d) is ramping up its murderous campaign in Nigeria against those who refuse to live under its inhumane rule. Journalists the world over face threats of murder. Officially secular China is continuing to aggressively censor its media and stifle religion, Christianity in particular. Xinhua, a Chinese Communist Party-run newspaper, called for more censorship in light of the Charlie Hebdo massa­cre. Russia, Vietnam, Belarus, Cuba, and many other nations also deny basic freedoms.\u000aConservatives are often chastised for saying we want to promote freedom and democracy around the world, as if it\u2019s some sort of imperial plot to subjugate the savages. Such couldn\u2019t be further from the truth. We tend to think that people around the world deserve to be free and that opponents of freedom must be challenged as much as possible. As history has shown, the expansion of freedom is hardly inevitable. And when there is more freedom, not only is there less oppression, but there is also a great flourishing of humanity, technology, and other forms of progress. Look at China since the death of Mao. Even a modi­cum of additional freedom in marriage, work, travel, trade, and thought has brought about an enormous explosion in well-being.\u000aThere is no reason why people in China, Chad, or Syria are any less deserving or capable of being free and creating Charlies of their own than Europeans or Americans. They should have that chance.\u000aAt home, we should work to maintain our democratic insti­tutions. Progressive justice warriors, resist the temptation to cen­sor others. Instead of seeking to silence those you disagree with, engage with them. When a straight, cisgender white male speaks, confront his ideas and not his traits. If you think something is im­portant, make your argument. Tweet. Post. Blog. Write. Speak. Debate.\u000aThe ones who bring about progress in society are often those with \u201cincorrect\u201d views. If the left truly wants to see socie­tal progress, as opposed to greater statism, allow for and engage with those marginal views. If they\u2019re good, help them go main­stream. And if they\u2019re not, defeat them with your arguments, not through censorship.\u000aWe want to live in a free society. You probably do too.\u000aJe Suis Charlie Image Source: Wikimedia Commons\u000aShare this:Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)MoreClick to print (Opens in new window)Click to share on Pinterest (Opens in new window)Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)Click to share on Google+ (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Tags: Claremont Independent Editorial Free Speech je suis charlieCategories: Editorial

aS'The End of the Women\xe2\x80\x99s College'
p891
aVBack in 2010, 76 percent of the Scripps College student body voted in favor of a measure to make the language of its student constitution more inclusive of those who did not identify as female at the college. Instances of \u201cshe,\u201d \u201cher,\u201d and \u201cwomen,\u201d among other terms, were replaced with gender- and sex-neutral phrases, such as \u201cthe student\u201d or \u201cstudents.\u201d\u000aNow that the Scripps administration has issued a new policy that allows for the intentional admission of transmen and -women, will it pick up where the students left off?\u000aEffective in the fall of 2016, Scripps will consider applicants for admission \u201cwho report that the sex currently listed on their birth certificate is female\u201d (including transmen) and \u201cwho self-identify as women\u201d (i.e., transwomen). The college advertised the admissions policy in a Dec. 6 letter as one that \u201creiterates Scripps\u2019 identity as a women\u2019s college.\u201d According to a FAQ page that the college created to address the new admissions policy, \u201cthe broader purpose of the women\u2019s college has always been to provide a safe haven to build the minds of the gender marginalized in our culture.\u201d\u000aThe proffered excuse for the new policy \u2013 that women\u2019s colleges are really institutions for the \u201cgender marginalized\u201d of society \u2013 strikes one as little more than an ad hoc rationalization. Scripps had an end \u2013 touting the popular liberal stance on the issue of transgenderism without compromising its identity as a women\u2019s college \u2013 and invented the means to get there.\u000aBut, of course, women\u2019s colleges were not created as institutions for every subset of the gender-marginalized of society. They were created as institutions in which to educate one particular group discriminated against in the higher-education market: women. And regardless of one\u2019s opinion on the politics of transgenderism, one of these groups, either transmen or transwomen, must be considered men. The intentional admission of men to an institution created for the purpose of educating only women does not reaffirm, but is rather a radical departure from, that institution\u2019s identity.\u000aAlthough the reasoning behind Scripps\u2019 new policy is dubious, will it have any tangible consequences? Not only could transmen who applied as women already attend the college, but admitting a few transwomen would seem to have a negligible effect on the Scripps student body and the experience of the average Scripps student.\u000aAs the administration rightly points out on the FAQ page, because of its situation as a member of the Claremont Colleges, Scripps has never been a space only for women. Even though Scripps will now intentionally admit men, men from the other colleges can already attend classes at Scripps, eat at the dining hall, and access many of the college\u2019s facilities as frequently as Scripps students themselves. The primary logistical problem that the policy presents concerns on-campus housing, but there are many remedies available to the Scripps administration to ensure that every student is comfortable with his or her living arrangement.\u000aYet, the policy still threatens to change Scripps irrevocably through a more subtle mechanism. It is not the physical presence of men, but rather the collision of the transgender movement with the values of the modern liberal campus that will ultimately be Scripps\u2019 undoing.\u000aOn a campus where every distinction is a \u201cmicro-aggression,\u201d every potentially offensive idea accompanied by a \u201ctrigger warning,\u201d and every hurt feeling satiated in its demands for reparations, Scripps cannot survive the politics of transgenderism unscathed.\u000aAlthough Scripps rationalized its new admissions policy with the purpose of serving the gender-marginalized, it will have to uproot many of its traditions and significantly alter its campus in order to ensure that those it claims to be protecting from gender-marginalization do not actually feel marginalized by expressions of gender at the college.\u000aTake, for instance, the college\u2019s unofficial motto, \u201cThe Women\u2019s College\u201d: How does a motto that excludes a segment of students at Scripps \u2013 on a particularly sensitive distinction, no less \u2013 aid Scripps in its mission to serve as a safe haven for the gender-marginalized? Will the Dean of Students Office dismiss the complaints of a male student who feels marginalized and out of place because of the women-centric rhetoric at the college \u2013 as if he were not really a member of the community \u2013 as if he were invisible? Will an energetic group of student activists \u2013 who already voted to rid their own bylaws of any reference to those with two X chromosomes \u2013 really stand for such injustice?\u000aWhy not change the motto to something more inclusive, such as \u201cScripps College: College of the Gender-Marginalized\u201d? Or, to take a page out of the student handbook, \u201cScripps College: The Students\u2019 College.\u201d At the very least, \u201cScripps College: The [Trigger Warning!] Women\u2019s College.\u201d\u000aAnd there are other elements of Scripps\u2019 campus that demand revision. When Scripps ornaments its campus with papier-mâché molds of the female anatomy, students who lack such a body, but still view themselves as women, may feel their gender identity being compromised before their very eyes. Mount Holyoke College, an all-women\u2019s school in Massachusetts, will no longer perform The Vagina Monologues for this very reason.\u000aIndeed, the experiences of other women\u2019s colleges are indicative of what Scripps can come to expect. Although Wellesley College, a women\u2019s college in Massachusetts, has not revised its admissions policy to include transwomen, it has become embroiled in the national debate because of the advocacy of several transmen who are alumni of the college, such as Alex Poon, who graduated in 2012. In her New York Times essay, entitled \u201cWhen Women Become Men at Wellesley,\u201d Ruth Padawer recounts Poon\u2019s experience of winning Wellesley\u2019s hoop-rolling race, a 131-year-old tradition at the college:\u000aA small local newspaper covered the event, noting that for the first time in the school\u2019s history, the winner was a man. And yet the page on Wellesley\u2019s website devoted to school traditions continues to describe the race as if it involves only women. \u201cBack in the day, it was proclaimed that whoever won the Hoop Roll would be the first to get married. In the status-seeking 1980s, she was the first to be C.E.O. Now we just say that the winner will be the first to achieve happiness and success, whatever that means to her.\u201d But Alex isn\u2019t a her, and he told me that his happiness and success includes being recognized for what he is: a man.\u000aBy continuing to call itself a women\u2019s college and decorating its campus with references to \u201csisterhood\u201d and other exclusionary terms and images, transgender students may feel overlooked at Scripps, like Poon and others have at Wellesley.\u000aPerhaps the all-women\u2019s college has simply lived long enough to see itself become an outdated institution in the battle for progress. Progress seems to dictate that Scripps no longer call itself a \u201cwomen\u2019s college,\u201d stop referring to its students as \u201cwomen,\u201d and rid its campus of any inordinate expressions of sisterhood.\u000aAfter that, what is it, really? Certainly not a women\u2019s college in any meaningful sense of the term.\u000aAnd, frankly, that is tragic, especially for alumni who are rightfully concerned about where this new admissions policy threatens to take a beloved college that they thought crucial to their development as women.\u000aSomehow \u201cScripps College: The Students\u2019 College\u201d doesn\u2019t quite have the same ring to it.\u000aShare this:Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)MoreClick to print (Opens in new window)Click to share on Pinterest (Opens in new window)Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)Click to share on Google+ (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Tags: Admissions Claremont Independent Scripps Scripps College Transgender women's collegeCategories: Opinion

aS'Skin Deep: The Pitfalls of Racial Preferences'
p895
aVCollegiate affirmative action policies, first institutionalized as a part of the 1960s Civil Rights Movement, were designed to provide minorities with equal opportunities to college admissions. These policies, based predominantly on recruitment and outreach programs targeting historically underrepresented groups, strove to increase social mobility, create diverse student bodies, and give promising students who were discriminated against an opportunity to achieve their full potential. These are all commendable and worthwhile goals, and colleges should work to achieve them. However, race-based affirmative action policies, as they are used in college admissions today, have failed on all of these fronts.\u000aThough more favored among underrepresented minorities than among whites, racial preferences are unpopular across all races. A poll sponsored by the Washington Post and Kaiser asked, \u201cIn order to give minorities more opportunity, do you believe race or ethnicity should be a factor when deciding who is hired, promoted, or admitted to college, or that hiring, promotions, and college admissions should be based strictly on merit and qualifications other than race or ethnicity?\u201d Only 3% of white respondents, 7% of Hispanic respondents, and 12% of black respondents supported racial preferences. For white students, this response is consistent with the idea that racial preferences serve as a tool of discrimination when it comes to admission decisions. For underrepresented minorities, the disapproval of race-based affirmative action may tie in with Peggy McIntosh\u2019s article, White Privilege: Unpacking the Invisible Backpack, in which she explains that minorities are concerned that others will assume they only got a job (or admission to a selective college) because of their race.\u000aAdditionally, disapproval of race-based affirmative action could be due to the fact that racial preferences actually have a negative impact on minorities\u2019 long-term success. While there are certainly plenty of black and Hispanic students who were academically successful in high school and, having received little to no admissions preference, went on to remain at the top of their class in college, this is not always the case. One of the biggest problems racial preferences introduce is the mismatch effect, wherein students are given such significant admissions preferences that they are academically under-qualified for the school they attend, starting at or near the bottom of their class from the get-go. Thomas Espenshade and Alexandria Walton Radford describe in their 2009 book, No Longer Separate, Not Yet Equal that, in their study of a large number of selective colleges (most of which were private), black applicants received \u201can admissions bonus\u2026equivalent to 310 SAT points\u201d over their white peers, and an even larger boost relative to their Asian peers.\u000aThe mismatch effect has had dire consequences. In their 2009 book, Mismatch, Richard H. Sander and Stuart Taylor, Jr. state that \u201cMismatch largely explains why, even though blacks are more likely to enter college than are whites with similar backgrounds, they will usually get much lower grades, rank toward the bottom of the class, and far more often drop out; why there are so few blacks and Hispanics with science and engineering degrees or with doctorates in any field; and why black law graduates fail bar exams at four times the white rate.\u201d\u000aSimilarly, Richard Arum and Josipa Roksa write in their 2010 book, Academically Adrift: Limited Learning on College Campuses, that the typical black student\u2019s GPA at top-tier colleges ranks between the 15th and 20th percentile of white students\u2019 GPAs. However, when controlling for all factors except for the size of admissions preferences the students received (including, for example, white students who received preferences as legacies or Asian students who received preferences as athletes), the racial disparity disappears. In other words, the reason minority students tend to get lower grades in college is not because of their race or because of racism against them, but rather because of significant preferences they received in gaining admission.\u000aSander and Taylor also note, \u201csharp increases in socioeconomic diversity can be achieved with preferences much smaller than those typically used to pursue racial diversity. We also know that mismatch is fundamentally related not to whether preferences are tied to race, SES [socioeconomic status], or athletic ability, but rather to the size of the preference.\u201d If colleges make the switch from race- based to income-based affirmative action, the harms of the mismatch effect will be greatly reduced, and disadvantaged students will have real opportunities to succeed.\u000aEducation is the key ingredient to social mobility, but attending college is an economic decision based on cost-benefit analysis. For low-income students, the cost associated with college enrollment\u2014which includes the expenses for tuition, room and board, textbooks, and so on, as well as four years\u2019 worth of foregone income\u2014is often enough to encourage them to enter the workforce instead of going to school. As a result, low-income students are hugely underrepresented in colleges, and thus have a harder time entering high-paying professions. Prestigious colleges provide students with a brand-name education and access to an alumni network that increases students\u2019 job prospects and earning potential substantially enough to make college an appealing choice. As such, it is imperative that qualified low-income students be given the opportunity to attend more selective colleges.\u000aRacial diversity need not suffer by switching to the income-based model either: African-American and Hispanic students are disproportionately socioeconomically disadvantaged, and thus would, in turn, disproportionately benefit from income- based affirmative action. The key distinction to make is that the reason for minorities\u2019 lower incomes is not exclusively because of their race: though racist policies of the past contributed to bringing minorities into poverty in the first place, this trend has only been able to continue due to the lack of social mobility that affects low-income Americans of all races. Income-based affirmatives action would address these concerns by targeting all students who are socioeconomically disadvantaged.\u000aFurther, income-based affirmative action programs would prove more successful than racial preferences at fostering other important types of diversity, such as geographic diversity and political diversity. Under the current admissions system, students from rural areas (and thus, students from most Southeastern, Western, and Midwestern states) are hugely underrepresented: rural Americans comprise 20% of the U.S. population, a far higher proportion than can be found at most selective colleges. Providing preferences for high-achieving low-income students from these backgrounds will help to introduce a broader range of student perspectives and experiences to colleges, thereby enriching the academic environment for all.\u000aWhen affirmative action was first introduced, its main recipients were African- American students who were the first in their families to go to college. Today, according to Sander and Taylor, \u201ca majority of African Americans receiving preferences at elite colleges and law schools themselves come from affluent families, usually with two college-educated parents.\u201d When controlling for all other factors, black students today are over 30% more likely to start college than their white counterparts, and yet black students are less likely to graduate from college than white students with similar academic attributes. In contrast, low-income students (defined as students at the bottom 20% of the socioeconomic distribution) of all races are 70% less likely to start college than wealthier students (top 20% of the socioeconomic distribution) with similar academic credentials.\u000aThis issue is particularly troubling when considered in broader context: racial preferences have gradually come to benefit affluent students at higher and higher rates, while income inequality is increasing and, therefore, putting low-income students of all races at an increasingly great disadvantage. If our goal is to help the disadvantaged to succeed and increase diversity at colleges nationwide, then colleges nationwide must make the switch from a system of racial preferences that has proven futile to a more effective income-based affirmative action policy.\u000aRichard Sander will be speaking at the Ath on Monday\u000aShare this:Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)MoreClick to print (Opens in new window)Click to share on Pinterest (Opens in new window)Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)Click to share on Google+ (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Tags: affirmative action Claremont Independent College Higher Education racial preference steven glickCategories: Opinion

aS'Bill Kristol Talks Microaggressions, the Media, and Newt Gingrich'
p899
aVBill Kristol has made quite the career for himself. Twenty years ago, after stints in government, the academy, and non-profits, he co-founded the Weekly Standard, the nationally influential conservative magazine where he is editor today. Kristol is also the Chairman of the Board of Governors at Claremont McKenna\u2019s Salvatori Center for the Study of Individual Freedom in the Modern World, which hosted his talk at the Athenaeum last Thursday. At the Ath, Kristol predicted that, like 1980, 2016 would be a foreign policy election. Unlike in past elections, among the Democrats, Hillary Clinton shall inherit the nomination, while Republicans will engage in a great intra-party debate. Whereas usually Republican candidates are older, whiter, and more staid figures as compared to a younger, more diverse Democratic field, again the roles are reversed. Clinton is approaching seventy. The Democratic field trends old, white, and traditional. But the Republicans contenders are mostly 40 or 50-somethings, diverse and dynamic. The Independent spoke with Kristol shortly after his talk. Here\u2019s what we said (edited and condensed for space and clarity):\u000aBill Kristol: Do people believe, since it\u2019s your generation, the microaggression stuff? It\u2019s just so ludicrous, I can\u2019t even\u2026 I don\u2019t know whether to believe the people who are making the complaints are in fact being honest and are in fact extremely sensitive people and don\u2019t know what the world is like. Or is it just a charade to sort of shut up other people?\u000aClaremont Independent: They definitely take it seriously.\u000aBK: So they really think they\u2019re supposed to go through their life never being offended by anything?\u000aCI: It\u2019s kind of like a personal attack\u2026\u000aBK: Even if it is a personal attack on you, like, so what? You\u2019re not guaranteed to live a life without being personally attacked. Someone might tell these kids that some time.\u000aCI: The Independent has made significant changes in recent years to adjust to the changing media environment. It seems the Weekly Standard has as well. What do you think about the ongoing digital disruption in media?\u000aBK: I think it\u2019s a big deal. Most of it is ways to get your arguments out. They shouldn\u2019t really affect the content of the arguments and I think the content is still crucial. You can be very energetic on Twitter and have very effective social media people. If you don\u2019t have something to say, it doesn\u2019t do you much good. So I think people sometimes overstate it in that respect. We started the magazine almost twenty years ago, and we thought we\u2019d be putting out a weekly magazine, and, you know, it would go through the mail and people would read it and it would have its effect. [Now,] everything goes online and a lot of the content is addition online-only content, and as many people read the weekly standard online as read it in print. For us, thank god, we still sell 90-95,000 copies a week of the print magazine. And that\u2019s good because that\u2019s revenue, and it\u2019s reassuring that people are willing to pay for the magazine, but so for us so far we haven\u2019t suffered for the fact that people can read stuff online for free. And of course, it has increased our reach. If people read a post or read one of the print articles online and it gets to an extra thousand people that\u2019s great. And so who knows where it\u2019ll be in five or 10 years from now.\u000aI do think generally, the magazine brand, I say this with some reluctance since I edit a magazine, the magazine brand might be slightly less important than it was twenty years ago. Of course, we still try to put out a good magazine, a variety of articles, short articles, long articles, foreign policy, domestic policy, but people don\u2019t really read it as a magazine the way they used to. In some way the individual authors become more important, the brand of the magazine, less so. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s necessarily good or bad, you know. Editors probably had too much control in the old days. So I\u2019m happy that individuals get more attention, but it probably does mean that the Weekly Standard as a brand isn\u2019t seen to be as distinctive as 30 or 40 years ago. I still think [the magazine] has a kind of certifying or credentialing effect. The fact is, if you submit an article to the Standard and we accept it and print it, it does mean that a bunch of editors have thought it was worth printing.\u000aPeople often ask, should I submit stuff to magazines, or should I just have a blog? And I\u2019m actually for blogs, you know, I\u2019m not a snob about this at all, but I do think if I were hiring someone, and you were 25 years old, and let\u2019s say you have a great blog, and linked to a lot and people liked it. It would still, I would still give an edge to people who had had articles published in the Weekly Standard, Wall Street Journal, and Los Angeles Times op-ed page, maybe, because it means that different editors thought his or her stuff was good enough.\u000aCI: Has the new age changed the nature of political talent, in terms of discovering and developing it? And what of political effects of Charles Murray\u2019s fears of America\u2019s Coming Apart thesis?\u000aBK: On the one hand, I worry as Murray does that there is a sort of self-sorting segmentation, where you don\u2019t get the kind of not-so-well-educated city boss of 50, 60 years ago who was a very shrewd politician and in touch with the voters, and a good, very good political leader, he just wasn\u2019t terrifically articulate, wasn\u2019t well-read, didn\u2019t have great manners. And we put so much of a premium now on a sort of superficial sophistication and I think that\u2019s unfortunate. On the other hand, I think the Internet and the general fluidity of things these days allows people to rise pretty quickly, from nowhere. I mean Obama, Rubio, Ted Cruz. These were not people who came from particularly well-off backgrounds or prominent families or anything like that. And they\u2019re pretty important people, so that\u2019s good, I think. I worry, though, a little, that we put a little too much weight on credentials: what college you went to and sort of how you present yourself, as opposed to what you have to say. And there\u2019s a little too much conformism for that reason, intellectually but also socially. Either way, you want people to be idiosyncratic. I do worry that the schools are more conformist than they used to be, less rewards for idiosyncrasy.\u000aCI: Is the new senate class more diverse than normal in terms of talents and backgrounds?\u000aBK: Yeah I think so, and I think that\u2019s a good thing. I mean Tom Cotton, Joni Ernst, come from their own backgrounds. A lot of them went to good schools\u2026 but yeah I\u2019m very encouraged as a Republican, as a conservative, particularly, of the quality of the younger Republican members, which I think is very much higher than it has been for several years in both the Senate and the House. It\u2019s also true of some of the younger governors.\u000aCI: Does the new tech/media age weaken the importance of elected officials?\u000aBK: Electoral politics is still very important. At the end of the day you need an elected official to carry the ball and to put an idea seriously in play. You can have all the think tanks all the magazines, floating this idea or that, but until some elected official comes along and says I\u2019m going to make this my legislative priority or president try to get this enacted, it\u2019s still sort of theoretical. I wouldn\u2019t underestimate the importance of electoral politics. It\u2019s also something about being elected in a democracy that gives you a kind of standing that you don\u2019t have if you\u2019re just editing a magazine or at a think tank. People think, oh it\u2019s nice that you\u2019re at a magazine, but there\u2019s something about the ballot box, about people actually voting for you over someone else, that gives a kind of credibility. So I think for a political movement, you should never ignore elected officials. What really matters is the quality of candidates. I think Republicans and conservatives actually for quite a long time had very good magazines, good journalists, good think tanks, not so good elected officials. I think that\u2019s been changing a little bit.\u000aCI: Among conservatives on campus, there is a strong preference for libertarian politicians like Ron and Rand Paul. Does a more dovish Rand Paul-type stand a chance in 2016?\u000aBK: I\u2019d be very surprised if the Republican Party went with a dovish candidate. [In 2011,] there hadn\u2019t been any obvious repercussions of what [Obama] had done. Of course he had a much more centrist foreign policy team. He had Gates. He had Petraeus. He had General Jones as National Security Advisor. And even Hillary. Now I think we\u2019re seeing some of the consequences of Obama\u2019s policies. And that\u2019s why I think that this will be a foreign policy election. Rand Paul in a way would have been better off running four years ago. He\u2019s much more presentable than his father, but his father actually ran at a time when there was really a mood in the party that was somewhat skeptical of interventionism. The consequences of noninterventionism are looking pretty grim these days, so that\u2019s why I\u2019m skeptical of Rand Paul.\u000aCI: Why are Republicans having such a hard time in California?\u000aBK: The state hasn\u2019t changed that much. So you\u2019d think that some Republican could occasionally win. I do tend to think that part of it is an accident of just candidates and sort of bad luck on Republicans\u2019 part. It is frustrating. You\u2019d think with Boxer retiring, there\u2019d be a chance to have an attractive Republican run for that seat, maybe a different type of Republican, one who is in sync of California. In 2010 they thought that having women run would really helped, and it turned out to not help at all.\u000aCI: Finally, many conservatives see that a lot of the negative trends our political system that Americans are concerned with today seem to be traceable to the late 60s or early 70s. Charles Murray\u2019s Coming Apart, for instance, or Peter Thiel\u2019s observation of a switch from \u201cdefinite optimism\u201d to \u201cindefinite optimism,\u201d originate in that era. What changed? Can we undo that?\u000aBK: Yeah, these things are deep trends, and obviously people like Tocqueville saw that this is kind of the way that democracy is tempted to go almost 200 years ago, so it\u2019s not even something that began in the 60\u2019s, but the good news I think is that all these trends are and often deep rooted but they can also turn around. I think that Peter\u2019s point on indefinite optimism is very interesting, though. To the degree that this is political, I do think that Thiel is onto something in a sense. I do think that the conservative agenda can\u2019t just be anti-government, Hayekian, almost, though I do think that\u2019s an important part of it. But also government is supposed to be limited and energetic, if you read the federalist papers. Lincoln certainly believed in a strong government for doing the things that government should do. And conservatives could be in favor of energy and competence, as well as limited government. I think the two go together. I think big government is bloated government, which is an ineffective government. So I think we conservatives have overdone the critique of government by itself, as opposed to critiquing government for doing things it shouldn\u2019t be doing. But also making the case there are some core government functions we want the government to do them and to do them well.\u000aCI: Newt Gingrich seemed the closest person in the 2012 GOP field to promote that \u201cdefinite optimism,\u201d but it seems hard for him to reach a broad swath of voters.\u000aBK: I think it wouldn\u2019t be so terrible to look a little bit like Newt Gingrich. I mean he has his flaws. I disagree with him on some things. But he was one of the more successful conservative leaders of modern times.\u000aIf the electorate is sort of demoralized, maybe someone with a little different background from Newt, someone military or sort of an organization that people think can get things done needs to step up and say we can get some things done. But I mean Newt ran only once for president, and he was a flawed candidate in many ways, but he did make a run of it against Mitt Romney, who had so much more money. I think there\u2019s more of a market \u2013 and I\u2019m glad you mentioned Newt \u2013 for a version of Gingrich\u2019s conservatism than people think. I think the mistake of conservatives is [the perception that] we just want to save money. We don\u2019t care about a space program. We don\u2019t care about any major scientific achievement. We don\u2019t care about interstate highways. We don\u2019t care about having great universities, which include public universities.\u000aShare this:Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)MoreClick to print (Opens in new window)Click to share on Pinterest (Opens in new window)Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)Click to share on Google+ (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Tags: Bill Kristol Chris Gaarder Claremont McKenna College Conservatism election InterviewCategories: Feature Interview

aS'The Price of Cuban Normalization'
p903
aVEver since the release of an American citizen following negotiations between Raul Castro\u2019s government and the Obama administration, the president outlined a handful of steps that he intends to take to better relations between the two countries. This represents a potential thaw in the cold relationship between Cuba and the United States that froze following Fidel Castro\u2019s historic rise to power and the United States\u2019 attempts to overthrow the communist regime.\u000aThe United States\u2019 announcement that it would pursue the normalization of ties with Cuba resulted in a national debate on its merits. Critics of the embargo claim that the cold ties with Cuba did not benefit the Cuban citizens, believing that normalization would result in a bottom-up change in the political and social climate of the nation. However, those who stand by the embargo claim that Cuba\u2019s leaders have yet to demonstrate any desire to change their political atmosphere and allow Cuban citizens the freedoms that the United States gives to all of its citizens.\u000aCuba has done nothing to demonstrate that it is ready for change. According to Freedom House, Cuba is \u201cnot free.\u201d The Cuban government denies Internet access and freedom of the press. On December 30, authorities detained journalist Reinaldo Escobar and other political dissidents prior to a free speech demonstration. Even after Obama\u2019s announcement to improve ties, the Cuban government continues to curb civil liberties and implements the same illiberal policies that are antithetical to what the United States represents. However, the United States continues to believe that normalizing ties with countries like Cuba could result in governments changing their policies and moving towards democratization.\u000aThis has been a continuous problem with American foreign policy since Richard Nixon normalized relations with China in the early 1970s. Despite opening up trade and economic relationships with Mao Zedong\u2019s government, the Chinese government continued to implement the same policies curbing speech and press freedoms. The 1989 student protests at Tiananmen Square resulted in a massacre by government troops. Stories about it are censored within China. Though the goals of Nixon\u2019s normalization with China were to put pressure on the Soviet Union and to facilitate the end of the Vietnam War, the continuation of Western influence on China did not result in a change of illiberal policies within the Chinese government.\u000aA less-discussed example of how United States\u2019 normalization strategy failed to bring democratic and social change was when the United States facilitated the creation of the Palestinian Authority. Following the Oslo Accords between the State of Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO), the United States played a key role in enabling the PLO to become a governing body in the areas of Judea, Samaria, and Gaza. In a nutshell, the United States and its allies believed that giving a terrorist organization funding, as well as access to the media, would result in changing Yasser Arafat\u2019s attitude and result in a peaceful end to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Arafat\u2019s successor, Mahmoud Abbas, not only embezzles the millions of dollars in aid given by Western countries, but he also denies his people the right to free speech by imprisoning journalists who speak ill of him. On top of that, he continues Arafat\u2019s genocidal campaign against Israel, inciting his people to kill Jews through the state-run media. Rather than displaying hopes for peaceful dialogue and coexistence, the Palestinian Authority under Abbas continues to promote separation, violence, and the denial of Israel\u2019s existence.\u000aIf history is any indicator, then it shows that unless a true change of government and leadership occurs, there will not be any changes to the undemocratic, illiberal policies that the United States and the Western world stand against. Cubans should not continue to suffer under a dictatorial regime that prevents them from exercising freedoms of speech and of the press. Why should the United States attempt normalization with governments that do not proactively work toward reforming their policies and giving their people basic civil liberties?\u000aThe United States should wait until Raul Castro firmly demonstrates his commitment to democratic reforms before the United States goes any further in normalizing ties with Cuba. How can the United States serve as a beacon of liberalism and freedom when it is willing to compromise on its core principles and normalize relationships with those who deny freedom to their people?

aS'An Evolving GOP'
p907
aVRecently, Representative John Boehner\u2014the eighth-most tenured Republican Speaker of the House in congressional history\u2014once again secured his place as the 53rd Speaker of the House of Representatives. However, growing unrest within the GOP sparked some congressional Republicans to nearly unseat their own party\u2019s sitting Speaker for the first time in history. The attempted coup signifies an unprecedented change among the Republican base: less desire for the career (and out-of-touch) Republican leaders and more desire for those who will fight for values, freedom, and, above all else, their constituents.\u000aLeading up to the recent selection of the Speaker for the coming term, Representative John Boehner ranked the least popular among congressional leadership, with Democrats no longer serving as his only critics: CNN reports that a mere 28% of the American public views the Congressman favorably, and Breitbart reports that 60% of Republican voters nationwide want Boehner replaced as Speaker of the House.\u000aPrior to the vote, a plethora of congressional offices received calls from their constituents requesting that Boehner be unseated. Those calls ultimately inspired 35-40 Republican Congressmen to pledge their vote against Boehner going into the selection process, which would have been enough to unseat him. However, when push came to shove, fifteen of those representatives repealed their decision in order to avoid potential punishment from the establishment leaders.\u000aFollowing the vote, the fears of those fifteen came to fruition as Boehner immediately removed both Reps. Webster and Nugent\u2014who campaigned against him for the Speakership\u2014from their respective positions on the House Rules Committee. Both politicians hail from Florida\u2014with Webster being the former Speaker of the Florida House and Nugent being a former Florida Sheriff and current Tea Party Congressman\u2014and were easy targets for Boehner as both served on a House Leadership Committee.\u000aAnother question to ask is why do a large group of Republicans dislike Boehner in the first place? Boehner\u2019s career record in Congress, as seen through spectrum rankings, offers some insight into the reason for his unpopularity: Speaker Boehner maintains a Liberal Action Score of 0%, meaning that he doesn\u2019t ever vote along DNC party lines. Oddly enough, though, Boehner also maintains the worst Conservative Action Score\u201411%\u2014among House Republicans. The numbers therefore suggest Speaker Boehner doesn\u2019t really take a stance on any big-issue topics. Boehner\u2019s only introduced legislation since becoming Speaker has been a lawsuit filed against the President in regards to the Affordable Care Act\u2019s constitutionality. These facts could potentially explain why both Republicans and Democrats are frustrated with Boehner\u2019s leadership: statistically, he appears to lack any real causes or values for which he adamantly fights.\u000aThis style of politicking does little to help the image of the modern GOP as a dysfunctional, and inhibiting body of legislators. However, I believe that voters are frustrated with old-image Republicans and want a new brand of GOP politicians who are willing to represent their changing views and individual liberties. The attempted coup within the congressional GOP taught us two valuable lessons. First, we learned that the American people aren\u2019t getting what they want from their supposedly representative leaders: of 40 Representatives asked by their constituents to vote against Speaker Boehner, only 25 of those Congressmen acted in accordance with the wishes of those they were elected to represent. Second, we learned that there are 25 honest and worthy Representatives in Washington who we must try to reproduce. This is not necessarily to say that we should elect men and women with their specific political stances. We must simply elect those who are willing to represent their constituents first and foremost\u2014which is what makes democracy a truly worthwhile system of government.\u000aWhether or not this occurrence will affect future elections is uncertain, but one thing is for sure: the GOP\u2019s establishment members are facing growing unrest within their own party. In 2014, we saw the sitting House Majority Leader Eric Cantor lose the primary to fellow Republican Dave Brat. We also saw Libertarian-leaning Republicans like Senators Ted Cruz and Rand Paul begin prepping for potential 2016 Presidential campaigns. In addition, Americans elected the first ever African-American Republican Congresswoman (Rep. Mia Love) and the first ever African-American Senator in the South since Reconstruction (Sen. Tim Scott).\u000aEven though these few instances may appear inconsequential in the grand scheme of things, the trend of change in the GOP is indeed gaining traction. Libertarian-learning Senators had never before served as front-line Republican politicians, an African-American Republican woman had never before been elected to Congress, and an African-American Senator from the South had never before been elected to the Senate. Though isolated instances hardly prove a monumental reorientation of the party, they do show that the GOP, for the first time in recent memory, is adapting its stances in order to include more voices in the Republican conversation. This more inclusive and diverse GOP is gaining support with young voters who want a more representative and freedom-oriented GOP. A recent Reason-Rupe Public Opinion Survey found that 53% of voters age 18-29 would \u201csupport a candidate who described him or herself as socially liberal and economically conservative.\u201d Pew Research also notes that among Republicans of the same age bracket, 61% support same-sex marriage. While abortion is still a heated topic on many college campuses, the GOP\u2019s stance on the issue continues to model the position of Americans, who favor Pro-Life policies by up to 11% over Pro-Choice policies. Although it does vary issue by issue, the Republican Party is indeed adapting an overwhelming portion of its social-issue positions.\u000aIn light of the recent \u201cRepublican Revolt,\u201d it is becoming more and more clear that the GOP is beginning to reshape itself. The changing Republican base is constantly encouraging the election of new-age politicians and the modernization of party platforms. If young conservatives continue the fight to elect true representatives of the people and politicians who will stand up for what they believe in, I foresee great future success for the Republican Party.\u000aImage Source: Wikipedia\u000aShare this:Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)MoreClick to print (Opens in new window)Click to share on Pinterest (Opens in new window)Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)Click to share on Google+ (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Tags: Political Diversity Republican PartyCategories: Opinion

aS'On Accidental Weight Loss and the Fear of Gaining it Back'
p911
aVLast semester, my friend Mohammad shared his story on weight loss and body image. He, in turn, inspired me to share mine.\u000aI began to lose weight in my final weeks studying abroad during the fall 2013 semester. My battle with clinical anxiety, which started two and a half years prior, had begun to take a toll on my body. When my worries surged, my appetite disappeared. My calorie count plummeted, and the weight melted off without any intention at all.\u000aI continued to lose weight upon returning to the United States, during winter break and the spring 2014 semester at CMC. Although I did not weigh myself during those periods, I quickly noticed that my clothing no longer fit as it had before. Pants that had once fit snugly around my butt now sagged; shorts that had hugged my thighs hung loose. A couple of my closest friends began to express concern about my rapid weight loss. I felt worried as well, but I was too mentally preoccupied to pay sufficient attention to the matter.\u000aThat changed when I returned home for the summer of 2014 and alarmed my family with my tiny frame. My parents and sisters were frightened by my weight loss, which had taken me from lean and healthy to thin-as-a-rail. I attempted to gain weight, but it quickly became a lost cause. By that point, I had lost my appetite altogether. Eating food had become a chore rather than a pleasure; I could no longer enjoy even my favorite meals, although I could nostalgically remember a time when I did.\u000aI hit my low point that summer, when worsening anxiety and a heart-wrenching breakup pushed me to 101 pounds. My original weight had vacillated between 120 and 125.\u000aI am 5\u20196\u201d. At 101 pounds, my body mass index (BMI) was 16.3. The generally healthy range is between 18.5 and 25. I had dropped from a size 5 to a size 0, which I hadn\u2019t worn since middle school. My doctors began to express concern that my weight loss could have negative long-term consequences on my health.\u000aMy appetite slowly began to return during the month of August, as I healed emotionally and found an effective treatment to manage my anxiety. I returned to Claremont last fall knowing that I needed to gain some weight. Still, I peculiarly remained reluctant to gain it all back. Despite my family\u2019s and doctors\u2019 insistence that I was too thin, part of me enjoyed my new frame \u2013 and the distorted confidence it gave me. At 101 pounds, I no longer avoided certain outfits in which I had previously felt self-conscious. With virtually no fat on my body, I felt nothing to hide, and I admittedly enjoyed that newfound freedom.\u000aUpon returning to Claremont for the fall 2014 semester, my reluctance to gain weight evolved into more of a fear. My weight loss appeared drastic to those who hadn\u2019t seen me since the previous semester, and I received a myriad of comments about my new body. Some people voiced serious concern, others mere observation. Some people actually complimented me on my weight loss and asked me \u201chow I did it.\u201d\u000aI had never before been very concerned with my weight \u2013 nothing beyond the standard self-consciousness that most women face. But as I received comment after comment on my body, I grew fearful that just as my peers had noticed (and even complimented) my weight loss, they would likewise notice any weight gain \u2013 and judge me for it. I feared losing control of my weight and being perceived as the Amelia who \u201clet herself go.\u201d I wanted to be the Amelia who kept herself together, and that meant I couldn\u2019t allow myself to gain it all back.\u000aI would not go so far as to say that I developed a diagnosable eating disorder, but I do believe that I was at high risk for one. For a large part of last semester, I found myself unduly concerned with maintaining my stick-thin frame. The warped confidence I felt being so thin, combined with the fear of judgment from my peers, kept me motivated to restrict my diet and complete early-morning workouts to keep the weight off. My body image was also significantly distorted. When I looked in the mirror, I did not see the scary slim body I had; I merely saw a thinner Amelia.\u000aMy distorted mindset was like quicksand \u2013 so easy to become sucked into, and near impossible to escape on my own. Thankfully, I was not alone, and I firmly believe that the support of my friends, family, and medical professionals are the reason I do not have a full-blown eating disorder today.\u000aAlthough I initially resisted their advice, my doctor, dietician, and psychologist (all amazing resources of the consortium) encouraged me to recognize my unhealthy behavior. These individuals served as a continual reminder that my weight loss was a medical concern, and that I needed to value my health over whatever social pressures I perceived.\u000aThanks to the work of those professionals, and the encouragement of my closest friends and family, I have gained some of my lost weight back. I have come to recognize not only how distorted my thinking had become, but also how difficult it is to resist. It has been hard for me to set aside my fear of being judged for weight gain, but I have slowly learned to value my health over the approval of others.\u000aIt\u2019s been even more difficult to dismiss the distorted confidence that being stick-thin once gave me. When I was a rail, I felt perfectly confident wearing crop tops, body-conforming dresses, and swim suits, because I finally looked like the women I\u2019d seen modeling such outfits in the media for 21 years. Now that I\u2019m healthier, and not as slim as a Forever 21 model, such pieces render me more self-conscious and, occasionally, make me miss my old body. I have to continually remind myself that my old body, although it gave me confidence, was unhealthy and, quite frankly, unattractive \u2013 even though I myself could not see it. And I\u2019ve come to value my health, and reality, before a warped and media-fueled sense of confidence.\u000aWhat I feel now more than ever is freedom \u2013 freedom from the perceived judgment of others, and freedom from the grasp of the media. I once allowed my concern for others\u2019 approval, and conformity with the media\u2019s depictions of beauty, to jeopardize my health and my happiness. I now feel free of those bonds, and I write this piece in hopes that it may encourage another woman or man to seek that same freedom. It is difficult to dismiss ubiquitous social pressures (I am still working on it!), but it\u2019s worth it. For when we reclaim the power we have surrendered to our peers and to the media, we can retain it for ourselves to break through warped perceptions of beauty, health, and approval. When we break through those distorted perceptions, we begin see the truth. And the truth, in turn, will set us free.\u000aShare this:Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)MoreClick to print (Opens in new window)Click to share on Pinterest (Opens in new window)Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)Click to share on Google+ (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Categories: Opinion

aVCharlie Hebdo\u2019s post-attack cover, representing a crying prophet Mohammed holding a \u201cJe suis Charlie\u201d (I am Charlie) solidarity poster. Charlie Hebdo says \u201cAll is forgiven\u201d above the depiction of Mohammed.\u000aThe recent terror attack against Charlie Hebdo in Paris is yet another example of the fact that there are people who so strongly wish to impose their views on others that they will silence their opponents by any means necessary. By using terror and intimidation tactics, extremists have attempted to scare those who disagree with them into silence, overpowering even the strongest laws protecting free speech.\u000aPerhaps the most troubling part of the Charlie Hebdo attack is its relevance to the modern American college, where the idea of \u201coffense\u201d as the ultimate danger runs deep. This problem prevents students who do not hold mainstream views from participating in discussion on controversial topics for fear of punishment by either their school or by their peer group.\u000aThough students, faculty members, and guest speakers are generally free from violence of this sort on campus, there is no shortage of closed-minded people striving to cut off the voices of those with whom they disagree. This phenomenon is known as the \u201checkler\u2019s veto,\u201d wherein unpopular opinions are silenced by threats of harassment and bullying from those who oppose such views.\u000aFor example, Daniel Mael, a student at Brandeis University, recently found himself under attack after he republished a classmate\u2019s controversial public tweets regarding the execution-style murder of two NYPD officers on a conservative website. Since publishing the article, Mael\u2019s classmates have called for physical violence against him and for his expulsion from Brandeis. Additionally, Mael\u2019s family members, including his parents and grandmother, have been threatened. Mael has been told by campus police that, upon his return to campus after winter break, he should expect his car to be keyed, his dorm room vandalized, and that other students may attempt acts of violence against him.\u000aSimilar acts have recently been perpetrated against Omar Mahmood, a student at the University of Michigan who wrote a satirical article about political correctness for the university\u2019s conservative paper, The Michigan Review. After his article was published, Mahmood was fired from his job at Michigan\u2019s institutional campus paper, The Michigan Daily, and his apartment was vandalized: students had thrown eggs at his door and left notes with messages such as \u201cshut the fuck up\u201d and \u201ceveryone hates you, you violent prick\u201d as well as a picture of Satan.\u000aIn essence, students at Brandeis and Michigan, respectively, tried to suppress their schools\u2019 stated commitment to free speech and punish Mael and Mahmood for their opinions in order to prevent them and others like them from saying or writing things they don\u2019t approve of.\u000aThe heckler\u2019s veto is frequently responsible for scaring controversial speakers away from colleges as well. In recent years, loud and disruptive protestors, including both students and faculty members, have prevented speakers invited to campus from effectively sharing their thoughts by interrupting and interfering with their speeches. This was the case at Brown University in 2013, when New York City Police Commissioner Ray Kelly\u2019s lecture titled \u201cProactive Policing in America\u2019s Biggest City,\u201d was canceled half an hour in after protestors grew so loud that it became impossible for him to continue.\u000aBut even more troubling is the fact that many speakers withdrew from giving their lecture at all due to the threat of disruption. For example, Christine Lagarde, the first female leader of the IMF, canceled her commencement address at Smith College last year after a series of anti-IMF demonstrations created a hostile environment at the college in which Lagarde felt unwelcome. Former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, who was slated to give the commencement speech at Rutgers University last spring, canceled her lecture in response to student protests criticizing her role in the war in Iraq.\u000aLast year also saw Robert J. Birgeneau, former chancellor of the University of California system, back out of his commencement speech at Haverford College after students and professors demonstrated against him. Even Haverford\u2019s president, Daniel H. Weiss, was upset that Birgeneau would not be speaking at Haverford, stating, \u201cwe have lost an opportunity to recognize and hear from one of the most consequential leaders in American higher education. Though we may not always agree with those in positions of leadership, I believe that it is essential for us as members of an academic community to reaffirm our shared commitment to the respectful and mindful process by which we seek to learn through inquiry and intellectual engagement.\u201d\u000aAs Weiss stated, it is extremely important to note that recognizing controversial public figures\u2019 accomplishments or providing controversial lecturers with a platform to speak does not necessarily condone support for all of their opinions or actions. It benefits students to be exposed to a broad range of perspectives and the people who hold them. In the incidents involving Lagarde, Rice, and Birgeneau, the students chose to censor themselves from ideas they didn\u2019t like, and created enough of a threat to those who held such views to prevent them from speaking their minds on campus.\u000aThe use of intimidation to suppress certain opinions has no place in a free society. Protesters should seek to promote an increase in discussion and understanding rather than seeking to prevent the other side from articulating its views. There can be no debate or intellectual curiosity if only \u201cacceptable\u201d arguments are allowed. We can only hope that, even in the face of intimidation tactics, people around the world will not back down in fear and will continue to express their opinions, however controversial, freely. Whether in Paris, Claremont, or anywhere else, free speech is the single most important element of a free society. In order to maintain this freedom, we must stand up for the right to freely express all speech, whether we agree with it or not.\u000aShare this:Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)MoreClick to print (Opens in new window)Click to share on Pinterest (Opens in new window)Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)Click to share on Google+ (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Tags: Free Speech Islam Political DiversityCategories: Opinion

aS'Broken Glass and Broken Trust: Lessons to Learn from UVA'
p919
aVBy: Derek Ko and Steven Glick\u000aSabrina Erdely published a story in Rolling Stone magazine on November 19 describing the brutal gang rape of Jackie, a student at the University of Virginia. The rape occurs after Jackie goes to a date function at the Phi Kappa Psi fraternity. Jackie had met her date, referred to in the story as \u201cDrew,\u201d at the university\u2019s pool, where they worked together as lifeguards. Erdely reports that, after going upstairs with Drew, Jackie is tripped onto a glass table, which shatters on impact. The article then goes on to describe a horrifying incidence of sexual violence against Jackie in which she is punched in the face and raped by seven men as three others \u201cgave instruction and encouragement\u201d over the course of three hours.\u000aWhen Jackie finally leaves the party, bleeding and covered in broken shards of glass, she seeks out her friends for help. However, her friends only exacerbate the situation, instructing Jackie not to seek medical attention lest she become, \u201cthe girl who cried \u2018rape,\u2019\u201d and they are \u201cnever allowed into any frat party again.\u201d\u000aThe shocking story galvanized anti-rape activists and feminists from across the country. In response to the story, the university suspended all fraternity activities until January. Protests broke out on the UVA campus in which students marched holding signs emblazoned with such slogans as \u201cUVA, Stop Hiding Rape\u201d and \u201cMen of Honor Do Not Rape.\u201d The Phi Psi house at UVA was vandalized, with windows broken and messages such as \u201cSuspend Us!\u201d and \u201cUVA Center For Rape Studies\u201d graffitied on its walls.\u000aA short while later, cracks in the story began to surface. Phi Kappa Psi released an official statement revealing that no party had taken place at their house on September 28, 2012, the day on which Jackie had allegedly been raped. Additionally, no member of the fraternity was found on the 2012 employee roster of the university\u2019s Aquatic and Fitness Center, which employs all lifeguards. More recently, The Washington Post has discovered upon further investigation that Jackie\u2019s friends, referred to as \u201cRandall,\u201d \u201cCindy,\u201d and \u201cAndy\u201d in the Rolling Stone article, had a vastly different account of their interactions with Jackie in the aftermath of her alleged rape. Among other things, they now claim that a photo Jackie had texted of her \u201cdate\u201d that night was actually of a high school classmate of hers who attends a different university.\u000aAs Jackie\u2019s account of her alleged rape has continued to unravel, many people have understandably become disappointed and even outraged by Erderly\u2019s poor reporting. Multiple articles have since lamented the damage that the article has done to the credibility of genuine victims of sexual assault. Many others, such as a Huffington Post blog post written by Katie Racine entitled \u201cDon\u2019t Let Rolling Stone\u2019s Bad Journalism Hurt the Anti-rape Movement,\u201d have been written with a clearly defensive tone. \u201cSo what if this instance was more fictional than fact and didn\u2019t actually happen to Jackie?\u201d writes Racine. \u201cDon\u2019t let the holes in this story diminish your rage, do not let the fire burning across our schools and nation be smothered by shoddy journalism and a troubled and traumatized girl who has clearly suffered.\u201d\u000aJulia Horowitz of Politico.com wrote, in an article entitled \u201cWhy We Believed Jackie\u2019s Rape Story,\u201d that \u201cto let fact-checking define the narrative would be a huge mistake\u2026 no matter if specifics of the article are true, \u2026reading the article as a college student, you were thinking, \u2018This could happen.\u2019\u201d\u000aHorowitz is correct in one respect. The reason so many readers initially believed Jackie\u2019s story was likely because sexual violence is still not as rare in our modern society as we would all hope. However, her assertion that fact-checking should not define \u201cthe narrative\u201d is short-sighted and irresponsible.\u000aThere is an obvious elephant in the room that much of the anti-rape movement is not acknowledging. In their fervent and well-intentioned efforts to obtain justice for genuine victims, many anti-rape activists and advocates have lost sight of the importance of facts and evidence. We have been told for well over a decade by the mainstream feminist movement either that people never lie about being sexually assaulted, or that those who do make up such a trivial percentage that such cases are no cause for concern.\u000aIn the midst of these dominant narratives, hastily concocted state and federal regulations such as California\u2019s recent \u201caffirmative consent\u201d law and the Department of Education Office for Civil Rights\u2019 2011 Dear Colleague Letter on sexual violence have been put into effect. Institutions of higher learning have been required to adhere to lower and lower standards of evidence while adjudicating cases of sexual assault on their campuses which they are woefully ill-equipped to handle in the first place. As a result, dubious cases of conviction and expulsion of alleged sexual assailants have multiplied, resulting in a litany of lawsuits filed against various colleges by those who claim to have been falsely accused and denied due-process. Caleb Warner\u2019s suit against the University of North Dakota, John Doe\u2019s suit against Occidental College, and Drew Sterret\u2019s suit against the University of Michigan are just three such cases that have been covered in detail by the Foundation for Individual Rights in Education (FIRE).\u000aThese dysfunctional policies were not born out of an aversion to the rights of the accused or contempt for fair trials. They were drafted, lobbied for, and implemented by people who care deeply about sexual assault victims. However, they also originated from the fundamentally flawed view that society must accommodate the needs and wants of victims even at the cost of due process. Behind this mindset lies the fundamentalist feminist idea that the victim in cases of sexual assault must be unconditionally believed. Those who have dared to even question the wisdom of this assumption have often been the objects of shaming and ridicule and referred to as rape apologists.\u000aIn the immediate aftermath of Rolling Stone\u2019s publication of Erdely\u2019s article, blogger Richard Bradley wrote that \u201cto believe it beyond a doubt, without a question mark\u2014as virtually all the people who\u2019ve read the article seem to\u2014requires a lot of leaps of faith.\u201d Robby Soave\u2019s article in Reason magazine, \u201cIs the UVA Rape Story a Gigantic Hoax?\u201d stated that, \u201cThis isn\u2019t a case of he-said/she-said; this is an extraordinary crime that indicts a dozen people and an entire university administration. Assuming a proper investigation\u2014which the police are now conducting\u2014confirming many of the specific details should be relatively easy. If \u2018Jackie\u2019 is lying, there is a good chance she will be caught (and Erdely\u2019s career ruined).\u201d\u000aBradley and Soave\u2019s articles were met with much criticism from feminist circles online. Jezebel published a response article titled, \u201c\u2018Is the UVA Rape Story a Gigantic Hoax?\u2019 Asks Idiot,\u201d in which the author, Anna Merlan, writes, \u201cIn summary, what we have here are two dudes who have some vague suspicions and, on that basis, are implying that Edeley either fabricated her story or failed to do her due diligence and didn\u2019t fact check what Jackie told her.\u201d\u000aIn even attempting to do the fact-checking that Erdely should have done in the first place, other journalists were initially slammed for having any doubts about Jackie\u2019s story at all. In a social climate where merely investigating the claims of a sexual assault victim is considered heretical, it really should come as no surprise that Rolling Stone\u2019s UVA article was so widely believed by other media sites or even published to begin with.\u000aTo be sure, when our friends seek out our support, we should never doubt the authenticity of their trauma and suffering. We should never demand to interview the alleged perpetrator or thoroughly investigate the incident before fully believing a friend\u2019s account of his/her sexual assault.\u000aHowever, as friends and confidantes of sexual assault victims on campus, we are neither prosecutors nor law enforcement officers nor reporters for a national publication. When someone privately shares his or her experiences of sexual violence with us, it is not our professional duty to adhere to strict journalistic standards or to prove guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. We do not have the power to expel someone from an institution of higher learning. We do not decide whether or not to put another human being behind bars for a significant portion of his or her life. We, unlike Erdely do not report for a publication with a readership of millions. For us, Erdely, or anyone else to personally believe the accounts of sexual assault victims is not a problem. In fact, this kind of trust is essential to being a good friend and advocate for sexual assault survivors. The problem with Erdely is not that she believed Jackie\u2019s story, but that she carried her personal trust in Jackie into her work as a journalist whose actions have wide-reaching consequences. In the professional world, verifiable facts are all that do and should matter. In our legal system and our media, we cannot and should not expect alleged rape victims to be believed (and their perpetrators presumed guilty) by default.\u000aThe UVA debacle demonstrates the importance of separating the personal from the professional when listening to the stories of sexual assault survivors. Though Jackie\u2019s particular case never resulted in a trial, it highlights the critical importance of due process and high evidentiary standards in addressing instances of sexual assault on college campuses. When these standards are lowered, even with the good intention of expediting justice for victims, the increased incidence of false accusations and unjust rulings is an inevitable result.\u000aThe fact that there are rare instances in which \u201cvictims\u201d lie is an issue that must be addressed in a pragmatic way. When false convictions happen, the lives and reputations of those who are falsely accused suffer irreparable damage. When evidence of false accusations and incorrect rulings comes to light, it is real victims of sexual violence that are hurt the most. Despite the fact that fewer than one in ten rape accusations are likely false, the harm that they cause to the reputations of sexual assault survivors is disproportionate to their frequency. Though incidents like that of UVA are disheartening, they are important learning experiences. Through prudent discourse, a commitment to due process, and high standards of evidence, we can all work to preserve both the rights of the accused and the dignity of sexual assault survivors.\u000a_______________________\u000aImage Source: Flickr/Holger\u000aShare this:Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)MoreClick to print (Opens in new window)Click to share on Pinterest (Opens in new window)Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)Click to share on Google+ (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Tags: Sexual ViolenceCategories: Opinion

aS'Free to Speak Against Oppression?'
p923
aVThere was recently a dispute at the University of California, Berkeley, similar to the George Will controversy at Scripps earlier this year, regarding the school\u2019s choice of commencement speaker. Bill Maher, a well-known liberal comedian, was scheduled to speak at Berkeley\u2019s December graduation. However, on his show \u201cReal Time\u201d a few weeks ago, Maher criticized the lack of freedom of speech and restricted rights for women and for people who are LGBTQ in many Muslim countries. Maher said, \u201cThese are liberal principles that liberals applaud for, but then when you say in the Muslim world, this is what\u2019s lacking, then they get upset.\u201d Bill Maher contends that liberals should be critical of those who do not afford free speech and human rights to all. The question he asked was, simply: why don\u2019t liberals care about these issues in Muslim countries as much as they care about them in the United States?\u000aShould Bill Maher be a persona non grata at UC Berkeley?\u000aIn response, many students at UC Berkeley protested the university\u2019s choice to have Maher speak at their graduation, and started a petition to disinvite him. According to CNN, the petition stated that \u201cMaher is a blatant bigot and racist who has no respect for the values UC Berkeley students and administration stand for\u2026we cannot invite an individual who himself perpetuates a dangerous learning environment.\u201d\u000aAccording to Merriam-Webster\u2019s dictionary, a bigot is \u201ca person who hates or refuses to accept the members of a particular group (such as a racial or religious group),\u201d and a racist is \u201ca person who believes that one race should control all others.\u201d Maher\u2019s comments were critical of the discriminatory actions taken by some Muslims in the name of their interpretation of Islam, not with the doctrine of Islam itself. He did not indicate in any way that he hated, refused to accept, or believed he should have control over Muslims. Maher\u2019s words do not \u201cperpetuate a dangerous learning environment\u201d\u2014he spoke out against those who are opposed to open-mindedness and freethinking. In other words, Maher spoke out against intolerance; therefore, his support of individual freedoms is the polar opposite of bigotry.\u000aSee April 2013 Pew Research Center Poll, page 93\u000aSee April 2013 Pew Research Center Poll, page 25\u000aUnder radical Islamic governments, as Maher pointed out, women and the LGBTQ community have very few rights. A 2013 poll from the Pew Research Center confirms this, stating that, for example, 92% of Muslims in Iraq, 93% of Muslims in Tunisia, and 96% Muslims in Malaysia believe that \u201ca wife is always obligated to obey her husband.\u201d Furthermore, the Pew study found that a substantial number of Muslims believe homosexuality is morally wrong. Even in Indonesia and Malaysia, two moderate Muslim-majority countries according to Maher\u2019s guest Nicolas Kristof (author of A Path Appears), the Pew survey found that 95% and 94% of Muslims, respectively, believe that homosexuality is morally wrong.\u000aSee April 2013 Pew Research Center Poll, page 46\u000aSee April 2013 Pew Research Center Poll, page 54\u000aAs Maher also stated, a large number of Muslims internationally believe that it is appropriate to kill anyone who leaves the Islamic faith. According to the Pew Research Center, many Muslims believe that Sharia law, also known as Islamic law, should be the official law of their country. Even in \u201cmoderate\u201d Indonesia and Malaysia, 72% and 86% of Muslims believe, respectively, that Sharia law should be the official law of the land. Of the Muslims surveyed who support Sharia law, a large number believe that the death penalty is an appropriate punishment for those who convert from Islam, according to Pew. Many Sharia Muslims also believe in honor killings, and believe stoning is the appropriate punishment for adultery.\u000aSee April 2013 Pew Research Center Poll, page 55\u000aIt is important to note that members of the Muslim faith are not alone in holding some of these opinions\u2014as one example, only 41% of American Protestant Christians believed that gay and lesbian relations are morally acceptable, according to a 2012 poll by Gallup. Bill Maher merely pointed out the double standard that is present when we condemn the Christians who hold these beliefs while simultaneously ignoring the very same injustices in Muslim countries. He did not claim that Islam is the cause of the beliefs; rather, he pointed out a correlation.\u000aIslam is one of the world\u2019s largest religions, with approximately 1.6 billion people practicing the faith. Like any large group of people, there is tremendous diversity among the world\u2019s Muslim population, and there are many different interpretations among the group, some of which look quite different from the picture painted by the survey. According to Aiman Chaudhary (PO \u201917), a practicing Muslim who grew up in Pakistan, the results of the survey are caused by the cultures of the various countries studied, not by Islam itself. \u201cThis largely has to do with the sociopolitical systems in place in the areas that this research has been conducted in. I think a lot of theology is often grounded in the culture and not so much scripture, in my own experience. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a matter of religion anymore, I think it\u2019s a matter of socio-cultural factors that you have been exposed to.\u201d\u000aHad the survey included American Muslims, the results would have looked very different, Chaudhary said. \u201cI think American Muslims would certainly answer the questions differently\u2014anyone who has been exposed to Western influences and the ideals of democracy and egalitarianism will answer these questions very differently. If you ask Muslims in America whether or not LGBTQ rights should be recognized, whether there should be marriage equality, or whether women should have the right to divorce and inheritance, I think a lot of these questions would come across as ridiculous to a lot of Muslims in America.\u201d\u000aIt is important to make a distinction between the Muslim faith and the politics of Muslim countries, particularly in countries like America where the two have little in common. In its 2013 Religion and Public Life Project, Pew Research states, \u201cIn their attitudes toward modern society and their relations with people of other faiths, U.S. Muslims sometimes more closely resemble other Americans than they do Muslims around the world.\u201d The Pew Research Center assessed the beliefs of Muslim Americans in its 2011 report, \u201cMuslim Americans: No Signs of Growth in Alienation or Support for Extremism.\u201d It found that 90% of American Muslims either completely or mostly agree that women should have the right to work outside the home compared to 97% of the US population overall. It also found that 39% of American Muslims accept homosexuality while 58% of the US population accepts it. In contrast, 45% of American Muslims believe homosexuality should be discouraged compared to 33% of the US population. Regarding support for suicide bombing and other violent acts against civilians, 81% of American Muslims believe these acts are never justified and 8% that they are often or sometimes justified. In comparison, only 19% of Palestinian Muslims and 38% of Egyptian Muslims feel that suicide bombing and other violence against civilians is never justified, while 68% of Palestinian Muslims and 28% of Egyptian Muslims feel it is often or sometimes justified.\u000aThough Maher\u2019s opinions are not Islamophobic, a person unfamiliar with Islam or the differences in the attitudes of American Muslims and Muslims in the rest of the world could generalize Maher\u2019s statements to the entire the Muslim community, which is Islamophobia. This, I argue, is deeply troubling. According to Gallup, there are only about 1.4 million Muslims in America (0.45% of the US population), which means that many Americans may not personally know anyone who practices Islam. The lack of interaction with Muslims makes it difficult for Americans to see and understand the difference between radical and non-radical Islam. The best way to gain a better understanding of the problems pertaining to radical Islam and the resulting Islamophobia that follows is to have an open dialogue examining multiple perspectives. Neither Bill Maher\u2019s nor the UC Berkeley students\u2019 criticisms are unreasonable, and for that reason it is important that both perspectives be respectfully considered. Much like Islamophobia, radical Islam is harmful and discriminatory, and protesting Bill Maher for speaking out against this is contradictory.\u000aBerkeley released a statement in response to the students\u2019 protest stating: \u201cThe UC Berkeley administration cannot and will not accept this decision, which appears to have been based solely on Mr. Maher\u2019s opinions and beliefs, which he conveyed through constitutionally protected speech. It should be noted that this decision does not constitute an endorsement of any of Mr. Maher\u2019s prior statements: indeed, the administration\u2019s position on Mr. Maher\u2019s opinions and perspectives is irrelevant in this context, since we fully respect and support his right to express them.\u201d\u000aThe Berkeley administration got it exactly right: Maher has the right to express his opinions, and the fact that Berkeley invited him to deliver the commencement speech does not mean that it agrees with him on this, or any other issue. Let the dialogue continue. As it does, let\u2019s also ensure that college campuses educate students about Islam, and the manner in which it is practiced in different regions around the world, including the US. In this way, we might ensure that discussions about radical Islam do not propagate Islamophobia.\u000aShare this:Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)MoreClick to print (Opens in new window)Click to share on Pinterest (Opens in new window)Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)Click to share on Google+ (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Tags: Bill Maher Free Speech IslamCategories: Opinion

aS'The Rotten Core of Scripps\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x9cCore I\xe2\x80\x9d'
p927
aVThe required Core I class at Scripps College is marketed both to current and prospective students as a course in \u201cinterdisciplinary learning,\u201d promising to teach the bright young women who walk through Scripps\u2019 gates how to think critically. As both citizens in a complex world and women grappling with future career demands, the ability to think critically about the information and many hidden agendas we face is one of the most crucial skills to learn in college. Sadly, in reality, Core I is only a vehicle for promoting an ideological agenda.\u000aTime to break out the hammer and chisel? Or the hammer and sickle?\u000aAccording to the description on the Scripps College website, the Core Curriculum\u2019s goal is to \u201cexpose students to some of the major concepts and dialogues shaping modern intellectual thought and challenge them to investigate and debate those issues by drawing from multiple perspectives.\u201d This could not be further from the truth. Instead of exposing students to \u201cmultiple perspectives\u201d on contentious and important issues, 250 Scripps first years are bombarded on a weekly basis with radically progressive ideological indoctrination by professors who allow very little room for opinions that differ from mainstream liberal thought, lest one be accused of \u201cmarginalization\u201d or labeled a \u201cbigot.\u201d\u000aScripps\u2019 Core I, Rotten to the Core\u000aThe course, generally made up of one lecture and two hour-long discussions per week, has thus far covered the topics of American slavery, the seizure of America from the Native Americans, a criticism of the American prison system focusing predominantly on how the system oppresses women and racial minorities, and a sexually graphic novel by Jean Genet entitled The Thief\u2019s Journal.\u000aOne semester isn\u2019t enough time to study these litanies of oppression in any real depth. As a result, we have been lectured only about the (obvious) injustices inherent in these actions and institutions. Not once have we examined statistics or economic analysis, or the complexities inherent in the historical context of even one of these topics. Instead, our professors have presented us with narrow criticisms of the vast majority of \u201cstructures of oppression\u201d that they believe keep the first world running, and the rest of the globe oppressed. These watered down Marxist clichés may be worth hearing, but if the goal of a Scripps education is to produce intellectually sophisticated citizens, it would perhaps be worth hearing competing theories, like those held by at least half of Americans, too. In my Core discussion class, our highly emotional discussions have primarily focused on the claim that students who are white, and presumed to be wealthy, need to learn to \u201ccheck their privilege.\u201d\u000aI attended a BeHeard forum at Scripps on the subject of \u201cMarginalization on Campus\u201d following the difficult conversations occurring in the Core I discussions. I went to raise the question of how a student with politically conservative views can participate in a Core discussion without immediately being attacked by the student body and professor. When asked how to combat some of the uncomfortable conversations going on in the Core I discussions, one student said that she believed most of the tension was stemming from \u201cstudents being confronted with their privilege in a way that\u2019s uncomfortable.\u201d She went on to say that she felt totally okay with students feeling uncomfortable and picked on in class as long as they were the \u201crich, white students\u201d because they have never felt oppressed before.\u000aBy her definition, it seems that the goal of Core I is not interdisciplinary learning or critical thinking, but instead some kind of twisted revenge fantasy where students who are assumed to have never encountered any kind of hardship are put in situations where they feel \u201coppressed, marginalized, uncomfortable, and violated.\u201d In what world, I wonder, is a classroom fueled by such resentment and hostility toward a certain demographic of students conducive to an effective, let alone healthy, learning environment?\u000aLater in this same forum, I asked how a student who has a different opinion about the merits and virtues of a particular \u201csystem of oppression,\u201d such as capitalism or the American prison system, could respectfully express a different opinion. How can students with views that don\u2019t share the liberal premises of the curriculum or professor be given a fair chance to express their opinions when it is instantly assumed that they are not just misguided, but actively perpetuate racism, sexism, and classism? My question was met by the inquiry of another student, who asked if I was saying \u201cthat I did not support equality\u201d \u2013 apparently unaware of the comment\u2019s irony. The student went on to assert that the discomfort I feel in a hostile classroom setting is not actually related to the suppression and distortion of political disagreement with the curriculum, but, rather, to my white guilt of having to confront my presumed privileges.\u000aMy argument had not just been dismissed as oppressive, but also irrelevant and unworthy of a thoughtful response, because it was actually just a manifestation of the guilt that I am supposed to feel in encountering such texts. When students can no longer see the difference between disagreements born out of reason and those born out of malice, they must believe that there is only one correct opinion \u2013 namely, theirs. And if having an opinion other than the correct one is oppressive, as is taught in Core I, then Core I is not so much about students critically examining their own thoughts and ideas, but instead about making sure everyone conforms to the same progressive ideology. Students are encouraged to verbally attack those who believe in individual liberty and personal responsibility, the pillars of thought upon which this country was built. It is clear in the Core I Curriculum that, while race, class, and gender marginalization are condemned, ideological marginalization is not only fair game, but encouraged.\u000aShare this:Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)MoreClick to print (Opens in new window)Click to share on Pinterest (Opens in new window)Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)Click to share on Google+ (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Tags: Claremont Colleges Core I Political Diversity Privilege Scripps CollegeCategories: Opinion

aS'The Not-So-Grand Jury'
p931
aVRecent grand jury decisions in Ferguson, Missouri, and Staten Island, New York, have \u2013 quite literally \u2013 wreaked havoc across the nation. Two separate grand juries decided not to indict police officers Darren Wilson and Daniel Pantaleo for the deaths of Michael Brown and Eric Garner, respectively. Both decisions led to uproars and protests on several college campuses, including the Claremont Colleges.\u000aOn Wednesday, Rep. Hank Johnson (D-GA) responded by introducing the Grand Jury Reform Act, H.R. 5830, which \u201cprohibits the use of a secret grand jury process when determining whether a police officer should be prosecuted for wrongfully killing another person while in the line of duty.\u201d The law would appoint special prosecutors to conduct probable cause hearings that are open to the public and require local law enforcement agencies to comply with the new process to receive federal funding.\u000aThe grand jury system isn\u2019t perfect. In fact, there are deeply troubling concerns about its undemocratic process that, as Rep. Johnson points out, warrant a closer look. But is his reform an effective solution?\u000aWhy are grand juries problematic?\u000aWhen the Framers included the grand jury indictment clause in the Fifth Amendment, they sought to provide a \u201ccheck\u201d on government by allowing ordinary citizens to curb ill-conceived indictments and prevent prosecutorial misconduct. In modern day proceedings, it has been argued that this constitutional \u201ccheck\u201d is either weak or largely absent.\u000aAccording to the Cato Institute, government prosecutors now have complete control over the grand jury process: they decide what will be investigated, what charges will be included, what subpoenas will be issued, what evidence will be introduced, and what witnesses will testify and receive immunity. The defense counsel is barred and no judge is present to provide oversight. Ralph Rossum, professor of constitutional law at Claremont McKenna College (CMC), noted, \u201cThere is a famous line that \u2018prosecutors can get a grand jury to indict a ham sandwich.\u2019 To the extent that that\u2019s the case, it represents a failure in the grand jury system because that means ordinary citizens are being manipulated by the prosecutor.\u201d\u000aFor those of us who fear big government, giving the government the immense power to essentially pick and choose who does or does not get indicted without any oversight sounds like our worst nightmare. And this is especially problematic in cases that involve law enforcement.\u000aOn the state level, our current system expects district attorneys to prosecute the same police officers who closely work with them on cases on a daily basis. Worse, district attorneys depend on these officers politically, since police union endorsements are critical for their re-election. Rossum points out, \u201cThe use of grand juries at the state level precedes police unions and the organized support of candidates for the district attorney\u2019s office.\u201d Given this modern political reality, it is unsurprising that grand juries indict police offers in only around 40 percent of cases, compared to having a near 100 percent indictment rate for all federal cases.\u000a

aS'Claremont School of Economics'
p935
aVAn annual topic of conversation in the Ivy League world is the rise of the economics major. As Kevin Roose points out in New York Magazine, economics has been the most popular major at Harvard, Princeton, and Yale for several consecutive years, with between 11 and 15 percent of degrees conferred in that subject at each school. The major is even growing in popularity at the usually unconventional Brown, where the proportion of students graduating with a degree in economics has risen from 4 to 14 percent from 2003 to 2013.\u000aThis is one of the many trends that author and notable higher-education critic William Deresiewicz laments in his recently released Excellent Sheep: The Miseducation of the American Elite and the Way to a Meaningful Life. Deresiewicz sees the rise of the economics major as a symptom of what ails academia: students at elite colleges are no longer incentivized to pursue their passions or cultivate potential interests (particularly in the humanities), but instead believe they must do whatever will land them the most prestigious and highest-paying job upon graduation (such as by majoring in economics).\u000aAs the cost of higher-education tuition skyrockets around the country, and as more students become saddled with burgeoning student-loan debt, it is difficult for students not to perform cost-benefit analyses of their educations. According to Deresiewicz, these sorts of external, market forces have transformed the university into little more than a stepping stone for the professions, not an opportunity to find one\u2019s true \u201cself\u201d or passion or calling in life.\u000aDeresiewicz\u2019s bête noire in the book is undoubtedly the Ivy League. (He holds three degrees from Columbia, where his father taught, and spent a 10-year stint teaching at Yale himself.) In this respect, Deresiewicz is not straying far from the norm; popular critiques of higher education \u2013 such as William F. Buckley Jr.\u2019s conservative cult classic God and Man at Yale, Nathan Harden\u2019s follow-up Sex and God at Yale, and Ross Douthat\u2019s Privilege \u2013 often have the Ivies in their particular crosshairs.\u000aBut Deresiewicz is also more than familiar with Claremont McKenna College and its students. He spoke on campus most recently Nov. 17 (his third visit in as many years) to promote the book, for which he even spent a month researching at CMC. While the majority of his criticisms are supported with statistics or anecdotes deriding the Ivy League, it is perhaps not surprising that much of what Deresiewicz has to say can easily be applied to CMC. Actually, if one takes the Ivy references and general focus out of Deresiewicz\u2019s work, Excellent Sheep reads as though it were written specifically with CMC in mind.\u000aTake, for instance, what Deresiewicz writes about the trend in higher education to characterize its central mission as one of creating \u201cleaders\u201d:\u000aWhat they mean is nothing more than getting to the top. Making partner at a major law firm, or running a department at a leading hospital, or becoming a senator or chief executive or college president. Being in charge, in other words: climbing to the top of whatever greasy pole of whatever hierarchy you decide to attach yourself to.\u000aHarvard and Princeton may say that they are creating the \u201cleaders of tomorrow,\u201d but can their students actually take courses or graduate with a sequence in leadership? While the Ivies may promote the idea of leadership \u2013 in Deresiewicz\u2019s view, a false one \u2013 CMC is obsessed with it.\u000aData Source: CMC Registrar

aS'Book Review: America in Retreat by Bret Stephens'
p939
aVThe Claremont Colleges have hosted a series of events discussing international relations and the United States\u2019 role in global affairs. On November 6, the Athenaeum hosted Stephen Walt, a professor at the John F. Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University, to discuss the challenges of current American foreign policy. During his lecture, Walt suggested that the United States should distance itself from intervening in global issues, claiming that it contradicted the American interests. In it, he employed the rhetoric of \u201cnation building at home\u201d while simultaneously claiming that American interventionism hurts the world as a whole.\u000aAmerica in Retreat: The New Isolationism and the Coming Global Disorder \u2014 Bret Stephens \u2014 Sentinel HC, 288 pp., $27.95\u000aBret Stephens suggests otherwise in America in Retreat: The New Isolationism and the Coming Global Disorder. In his first book, Stephens takes arguments for isolationism from the likes of Henry Wallace and Rand Paul, and contends that the greatest threat to global security is the absence of American influence globally. He looks into the recent decisions of the Obama Administration to withdraw from Iraq and Afghanistan, as well as the recent emphasis on using diplomatic methods against Iran, Russia, and China. He then predicts that this will all result in the United States losing the ground it acquired following World War II and the Cold War.\u000aHe recounts the failed track record of isolationism starting from the days of Henry Wallace and Robert Alphonso Taft, two prominent politicians active before and after World War II. Taft, a staunch Republican, opposed American intervention against Nazi Germany, arguing that there was no difference between the warmongering cries of Hitler and that of Roosevelt. Wallace, a progressive Democrat, argued that the United States should avoid exacerbating the rise of Communism by ignoring Stalin\u2019s campaigns in Eastern Europe. These voices remain integral to the current isolationist theory that natural order would be restored if the United States left the world alone.\u000aBret Stephens, winner of the 2013 Pulitzer Prize for commentary, is the foreign affairs columnist and deputy editorial page editor of The Wall Street Journal.\u000aWhile Wallace argued that increased American intervention against the Soviets would curb civil liberties, the United States progressed at home, defeating Jim Crow and empowering both women and the LGBTQ community in unprecedented ways. Contrary to the nondemocratic policies of the Soviets, American power both furthered social progress and ensured freedom and democratic values by ensuring capitalism in Western Europe, keeping South Korea free from Communism, and helping Israel thrive as the only democracy in the Middle East. According to Stephens, interventionist policies preserve American values of liberalism and tolerance and it prevailed over the asinine ideals of totalitarianism and collectivism.\u000aWhile arguing that American interventionism remains of paramount importance to America\u2019s success globally and domestically, Stephens recognizes that America is prone to mistakes. He highlights that the Iraq War was just in its mission to remove the dictatorial Saddam Hussein, but took a devastatingly wrong turn when Paul Bremer disbanded the army and ousted many public figures in order to restart the Iraqi government. That transformed the American military from a liberating force into an occupying force.\u000aOur generation did not live with the Cold War. Rather, we lived with a War on Terror that was well intentioned but improperly managed. Because we have been exposed to that as our reality, we fail to acknowledge how the history of appeasement and isolationism allowed malicious actors to go unchecked. It makes it easier for us to oppose interventionist policies because we kept seeing it in a negative light rather than realize how significant it was in maintaining global order. We are further disillusioned when we hear idealistic calls to make peace and build up ourselves to acknowledge the harsh realities that our world faces.\u000aWith Vladimir Putin\u2019s annexation Crimea, Chinese strong-arming control of various seas and islands, and Iran pursuing the development of nuclear weapons, Stephens argues that United States cannot continue its path of retreat when it has historically upheld order. As both a military and economic superpower, the United States has the capability to create powerful influences and ensure that global disorder does not ensue. However, Obama\u2019s decision to cut back military power, American influence, and involvement in places like Syria and Crimea has resulted in a world without American foreign assistance to rely on. This is especially true of Saudi Arabia and Israel, which heavily rely on the America\u2019s support against unstable neighbors.\u000aWhat makes Stephens\u2019 assertion particularly relevant is how the United States is losing credibility in the global sphere. Our perceived weakness further incentivizes historical adversaries to march toward a path that will spiral out of control. We have seen how Islamic State has ravaged through the failed states of Iraq and Syria, which could have been avoided if we had acted. Most importantly, our focus on \u201cnation building at home\u201d makes us less relevant in the global sphere. In my view, this line of thinking not only endangers our national security, but it also endangers the free world\u2019s capabilities of creating spheres of influence in places where human rights violations are ignored and, in the worst cases, tolerated.\u000aThe moral of America in Retreat is that the United States cannot entirely retreat from its position as a beacon of order in a chaotic, unstable world. Stephens argues that presence of disorder will result in a snowball effect that leads to more chaos. If the United States starts policing the world in a manner that does not require prolonged military presence in other countries, but also gets the job done, then military intervention is something that the United States should pursue to maintain order. The United States is a strong economic and military power and it has the ability to ensure that the world does not fall to totalitarianism, extremism, and non-Western ideals. Therefore, the United States should revitalize its interventionist policies to keep chaos at bay.\u000a__________________\u000aImage Sources: Bret Stephens, Department of Defense/Flickr\u000aShare this:Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)MoreClick to print (Opens in new window)Click to share on Pinterest (Opens in new window)Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)Click to share on Google+ (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Tags: Book Review Foreign PolicyCategories: Feature

aVNovember 4th was a good day for Republicans. They won the Senate and significantly expanded their majority in the House. In 2015, they will hold 31 of 50 governorships and control 69 out of 99 state legislative chambers. But is the Republicans\u2019 success a victory for America?\u000aIf conservatives want their recent successes to have real meaning, they must offer their own positive agenda for 2015 and beyond. When the GOP only controlled one half of one branch of the federal government, it had a hard time making its case to the nation. Now there are no excuses.\u000aOver the years to come, conservatives should emphasize that their policies are good for all Americans. Republicans in Congress and in statehouses across the nation could pass a new reform bill every day to restore confidence in our nation\u2019s political institutions. Every day, Congress could put a popular bill with Democratic support on the President\u2019s desk. Obamacare fixes. Immigration reforms. Anti-poverty efforts. Trade bills. Education bills. Body camera laws. Prison reform. You name it, every day. Whenever the President vetoes these bills, then it\u2019s on him.\u000aConservatives must propose solutions to problems in our criminal justice system. We should not hesitate to acknowledge the role of modern policing in the precipitous decline of rape and murder in recent years. But some aspects of the criminal justice reform need fine tuning \u2013 adding body cameras on police, for instance, makes sense.\u000aTexas, one of the most conservative states in the nation, has recently found incredible success in reforming their prison system, which used to be one of the most broken (not to mention expensive) in the nation.\u000aIn true conservative form, Texas chose to focus on the individual criminal and the choices they made that led them to commit crimes in order to fix the way prisons worked in the state. Through programs such as the Prison Entrepreneurship Program, which teaches inmates useful business skills and even offers them a chance to get a certificate of entrepreneurship from the Hankamer School of Business at Baylor University, Texas has been able to enable inmates to find employment options when they leave jail.\u000aBecause of its effective reforms, Texas has been able to close three prisons instead of building new ones. As Marc Levin, a criminal justice researcher with the Texas Public Policy Foundation, notes, \u201cstudies have shown that vocational education reduces recidivism more than anything else you can do\u201d. The Prison Entrepreneurship Program is an especially good example of this, as it has been found to reduce recidivism by 380% compared to the average of other rehabilitation programs in Texas, not to mention yielding a 340% return on investment due to avoided incarceration, increased child support payments, and reduced reliance on government assistance. All of these programs focus on building a sense of purpose, community, and brotherhood between past and current inmates, and are all built upon a foundation of conservative values of liberty and personal freedom (it is Texas, after all).\u000aInstead of increasing the reach of the nanny state, Texas has shown that empowering individuals to lead the life they want to live discourages a life of crime. Texas\u2019s conservative approach to law enforcement, one that seeks to do more than tear people down, should be lauded across the nation.\u000aNow that conservatives have regained power across the nation, it is time for them to show America that conservative values can not only empower people to live the life they choose, it can also help them get back on their feet when they fail.\u000aShare this:Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)MoreClick to print (Opens in new window)Click to share on Pinterest (Opens in new window)Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)Click to share on Google+ (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Tags: Criminal Justice System Reform Conservatism Republican PartyCategories: Editorial

p947
aVWhat does a group of scantily clad male models have to do with politics? According to women\u2019s magazine Cosmopolitan, it\u2019s the perfect way to involve college-aged women in the political process and save them from those who would take away their rights if elected. Halloween may be long gone, but that doesn\u2019t mean certain political parties haven\u2019t used some of the scariest tactics around to try to convince young women to vote for their candidates.\u000aCosmopolitan\u2019s Election Day competition awarded a party bus to students at North Carolina State University to take student voters to the polls on Election Day. The ploy, which included male models, as well as snacks and \u201cswag\u201d on the bus, was intended to encourage young women to participate in the political process and vote for issues that matter to them. But instead of encouraging thoughtful debate about politics and some of the greatest issues facing our country this midterm election cycle, Cosmo endorsed 10 Democratic candidates based on their views on issues they believe are important to women\u2014contraception, abortion, and equal pay.\u000aSelf magazine, another publication directed at women, published an article entitled, \u201cWhy You Should Definitely Count Yourself In When It Comes to Voting,\u201d which stressed how important it was for women to vote in this election to protect their interests when it came to reproductive rights, paid family leave and sick days, and education.\u000aBoth of these articles, and many more directed exclusively at women, emphasized how important this election was to women and how a Republican majority in the Senate would harm women and set back \u201cwomen\u2019s issues.\u201d This fear-inducing rhetoric on \u201cwomen\u2019s issues\u201d came directly from the Democratic Party, which has claimed to side with women on issues that are important to them, unlike the \u201cold, white men\u201d of the Republican Party.\u000aWomen\u2019s Issues, According to Democrats.\u000aBut what are \u201cwomen\u2019s issues\u201d? The availability of contraception? The right to an abortion if one chooses? Education policy? Equal pay and paid family leave? Politics have stereotyped women into these narrow categories, assuming that, because we are women, we care only, or primarily, about reproductive rights, children, and gender equality.\u000aNot Women\u2019s Issues?\u000aFalse. I am a woman, but I refuse to be pulled and twisted to fit into the tiny box labeled \u201cwomen\u2019s issues.\u201d Yes, I value my reproductive rights and my right to fair pay and equality, but I refuse to completely ignore some of the greatest issues facing our nation. We are still struggling economically, and our national debt is sky-high and growing every day. We have failed to pass comprehensive immigration reform, and our national security is threatened by global chaos. I am a woman and these are issues I care about.\u000aI know I am not the only woman who refuses to be talked down to about how important \u201cwomen\u2019s issues\u201d are to me. I know this because Wendy Davis, the Democratic candidate for Governor in Texas, who gained national attention for her 11-hour filibuster of a bill that would have banned abortions 20 weeks after conception, lost the women\u2019s vote to her Republican opponent, 45 percent to 54 percent, according to CNN exit polls. Davis was the ultimate \u201cwomen\u2019s issues\u201d candidate for the Democratic Party, and she still didn\u2019t win over women in Texas, meaning either not all women agree with her stances on these issues or women sided with her Republican counterpart on issues they believed were more important to their state than just \u201cwomen\u2019s issues,\u201d or some combination of the two.\u000aDon\u2019t get me wrong. The issues that political parties use to capture the traditional women\u2019s vote are important to me, but I don\u2019t believe they are intrinsically more important than any of the other hot-button issues facing America this year. Personally, I find it insulting that politicians and political parties automatically assume these issues are all that matter to me when I check the little box that says \u201cfemale,\u201d and so should you. We are all strong, smart, thoughtful, independent women, and it is up to us to change the way we are treated by political parties. Don\u2019t let them put us on a bus with a bunch of male models and convince us to vote for a candidate simply because she is pro-choice, because there is so much more to politics than so called \u201cwomen\u2019s issues.\u201d\u000aShare this:Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)MoreClick to print (Opens in new window)Click to share on Pinterest (Opens in new window)Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)Click to share on Google+ (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Tags: Democratic Party election Republican Party Women's IssuesCategories: Opinion

aS'Featured Organization: Liberty in North Korea (LiNK)'
p951
aVLiberty in North Korea (LiNK) at the Claremont Colleges is an organization that seeks to bring awareness to the issues faced by people living under the rule of the North Korean regime. It is part of a larger international non-profit of the same name that has focused on rescuing North Korean refugees from Northeast China\uff0cmany of whom live in hiding and risk repatriation at the hands of the Chinese authorities. Another major goal of LiNK is to change the dominant narratives that are disseminated in the mainstream media on North Korea and its people. It was this dimension of LiNK\u2019s mission that inspired Julie Kim CMC \u201917 to start a Claremont chapter of the organization. \u201cI think there is a tendency in the media to focus too much on politics,\u201d says Kim regarding coverage of North Korea. \u201cThere should be more emphasis on how we can empower the North Korean people.\u201d\u000aWhile many students in Claremont may have been taught to see the North Korean problem through the lenses of international politics or nuclear nonproliferation, Kim sees it primarily as a human rights issue. She also believes that it is important for the international community to view North Koreans not as powerless, oppressed people, but as agents of bottom-up change in their country.\u000aKeighley Overbay HMC \u201917 expressed similar sentiments when talking about her motivation for joining LiNK at the Claremont Colleges. She describes how, instead of merely pitying the people of North Korea, LiNK brought a refreshing perspective to the scene by appreciating their strength.\u000a\u201cI think LiNK really embodies that attitude by focusing on the citizens and their stories, which are really important to understand and help the people from that country,\u201d said Overbay.\u000aHowever, even as organizations like LiNK seek to empower North Koreans at the grassroots, the situation for the North Korean people remains undeniably harsh. Currently, the Kim regime punishes three generations of a dissident\u2019s family members for \u201cpolitical crimes\u201d committed against the state. Korean refugee outflow has fallen since the rise of Kim Jong Un, indicating a crackdown on defectors in the last few years. Those who do manage to escape to neighboring China often become victims of sex trafficking or deportation. Once beyond North Korean borders, the typical refugee faces a 2,500km journey along a modern underground railroad to Southeast Asia where their resettlement either South Korea or the U.S. is arranged. Due to the highly secretive nature of their work, LiNK Field Coordinators, who are responsible for refugee rescue, do not have their names or photos listed on the LiNK website. As a result of the logistical challenges of arranging such a rescue, it currently costs LiNK an estimated $3,000 USD to rescue a single refugee.\u000aStill, Claremont Colleges LiNK Chapter President Julie Kim remains confident that the Claremont community can make important contributions to the North Korean cause. Already, the organization has hosted a speaking event as part of LiNK\u2019s Jamadang Tour aiming to educate the public about North Korean millennials who have begun subverting the North Korean regime through their use of the black market. With further fundraising, the Claremont chapter of LiNK plans to organize future events, and possibly even fund a refugee rescue. As Kim points out, the cumulative effect of individual contributions can make a significant impact.\u000a\u201cLiNK recently started a campaign to rescue 200 refugees,\u201d says Kim. \u201cIt is only through individuals like us that this kind of change is made possible.\u201d\u000a____________________________\u000aLiberty in North Korea at the Claremont Colleges meets every Monday at 9pm at International Place.

aS'Noon Classes Cut, Dining Halls Crowd'
p955
aVThis year, the 5Cs eliminated the 12:00 p.m. class time slot, causing longer lunch lines with no classes to mitigate the influx of students into the dining halls at that time. Some have speculated that the decision to remove the class time slot was because the 5C administrations wanted to make sure that students had enough time to eat lunch. However, after reaching out to CMC administration, it appears that there were actually three unrelated reasons for the change in policy.\u000aFirst, the class time slot had previously been from 12:00 to 1:10 p.m. and, therefore, five minutes shorter than other time slots that also met twice a week. Clearly, this was an issue that needed to be resolved. Although five minutes does not seem like much on a class-to-class basis (and most students would probably welcome a shorter class), it adds up over time. This would mainly be an issue if a professor teaches the same class during any other time slot, as the two may begin to progress at different rates.\u000aThe second reason the 5C administrations decided to get rid of the 12:00 p.m. class slot is that it only allowed for five minutes of passing time for students to get to classes immediate afterward, in the 1:15 p.m. time slot, which is one-third of the normal 15 minute passing times allotted between classes. Again, it appears here that a logistical issue is what motivated the elimination of the class slot. This was an issue for many students, particularly those who, say, had a 12:00 p.m. class at CMC and then a 1:15 p.m. class at Pomona or Pitzer. Five minutes is hardly even enough time to get across CMC\u2019s campus from Bauer to Kravis, let alone across the 5Cs.\u000aThe final reason given by the administration for the change is that Pomona did not have that same time slot, which was a concern for cross-campus registration. Indeed, without consistency throughout the 5Cs in terms of class time slots, cross-campus registration becomes very difficult, which is an aspect that attracted many students to consortium style enjoyed by the Claremont Colleges in the first place.\u000aAlthough these were definitely problems worthy of addressing, there is still some debate over whether this was the most practical way to solve these logistical issues.\u000a\u201cPersonally, I always liked teaching at noon,\u201d CMC\u2019s Interim Dean of Faculty Nicholas Warner said in an email to the Claremont Independent. Warner also noted that \u201cto some extent, the shift to common course times among the Claremont Colleges had the unintended consequence of impacting lunch.\u201d\u000a\u201cI am hopeful that we will straighten out the schedule and offer noon classes again and relieve the pressure on Collins,\u201d Warner said.\u000aIt is quite evident that the current long lunch lines are a direct result of removing time 12:00 p.m. class time slot; however, the motivation for the policy change was not 5C administrations trying to ensure that every student had time to eat lunch, as widely speculated. Rather, it was merely an unintended consequence of trying to allow for easier cross-campus registration.\u000aShare this:Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)MoreClick to print (Opens in new window)Click to share on Pinterest (Opens in new window)Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)Click to share on Google+ (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Tags: Class Scheduling Collins Dining HallsCategories: Campus News

aS'Redefining the Lines'
p959
aVAfter spending nine months in the State of Israel, Bryan Turkel, a brother of Alpha Epsilon Pi and a proud Zionist, returned to Claremont McKenna with full intention of displaying his identity. Upon his arrival, he placed a mezuzah at his doorpost. His father bought it for him in Jerusalem, Judaism\u2019s holiest city, and Turkel viewed it as a sign of his redefined commitment to his faith and culture. A week later, in a statement of Zionist pride, he hung a large Israeli flag over his window in Green Hall. To him, both items symbolized what was a transformative experience that defines him to this day.\u000aHowever, within a week or two of it being unfurled, his Israeli flag was stolen. Someone had damaged the screen to his window and snatched the flag from the outside. This act was seen as a political act protesting his Zionism, and could not have been connected to his commitment to Judaism. However, someone stole his mezuzah three days later. The timing was suspicious, as he had been targeted for a second time and the culprit specifically targeted his cultural and religious identity. In a matter of 72 hours, the line between anti-Zionism and anti-Semitism became nonexistent; the vandals blurred the line that should have separated the two ideologies.\u000aUnfortunately, such incidents have occurred frequently, but they intensified over the summer. Following Israel\u2019s counteroffensive against Hamas terrorism, massive protests condemning Israel\u2019s acts of self-defense spilled over into attacks against the Jewish people as an entity. In France, anti-Zionist protestors torched synagogues following anti-Israel rallies. When I was in Boston this summer, people held signs that used the ancient anti-Semitic blood libel against Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, claiming that he was thirsty for Palestinian blood. Even after the final ceasefire agreement came to fruition in late-August, many college campuses have experienced problems where Jewish institutions faced scrutiny and were targeted by anti-Israel groups for supposed or blatant support for Israel. This disturbing phenomenon of conflating Zionism with Judaism explains how the acts committed against Turkel unfolded.\u000aThis must end here and now. The misconception inspiring such attacks is that all Jews are Zionists and vice versa. Such notions are simply incorrect, as there are plenty of Jews that do not identify as Zionist and there are many Zionists who are not Jewish. When discussing Jewish faith and culture, we talk about how our cultures differ in dialects, customs, and food, but we all share the same texts, the same language, the same core values, and, most notably, land of origin. Jews also come from many tribes, including places like Europe; Ethiopia; North Africa Spain; Yemen, Iraq, and Syria. The Jewish people originated from the land of Judea, where the modern State of Israel lies. There are archaeological, religious, and historical connections between the Jewish people and the Land of Israel. Attacking a Jewish student in any of those aspects is anti-Semitic. But when it comes to Zionism, the Jewish identity must be separated from politics.\u000aLike every other state in the world, the State of Israel is not perfect. It faces challenges within a hostile environment where its neighbors have historically or continuously called for its destruction. The same way Americans criticize the Obama administration or every other presidency, criticizing Israeli policy and its government has a place in dialogue and debate. But as long as individuals do not cross the boundaries of demonizing, delegitimizing, or holding double standards against the Jewish state, including calling Netanyahu a blood thirsty tyrant or denying Israel\u2019s right to exist as a Jewish state, then one can argue objections to Israel are not anti-Semitic. One can debate a Zionist or a pro-Israel student without incorporating aspects of Jew-hatred in the same manner that anyone can criticize the United States without being anti-American.\u000aWe as a community must redefine the line between anti-Zionism and anti-Semitism. If we continue to conflate political Zionism with Jewish identity and culture, then it will surely keep dividing communities and putting Jewish people in danger. Simultaneously, the same must be said about criticizing Hamas, the Palestinian Authority, and terrorism while not conflating Arab and Palestinian identities as equitable to the terrorist-supporting governments. This means that one can be pro-Palestinian as well as pro-Israel, since one can support the self-determination of both peoples while criticizing the actions of those in power in either or both sides of this emotionally-charged conflict.\u000aMy greatest concern, however, remains the safety of the Jewish community in Claremont. After Turkel had his second mezuzah torn down a few weeks ago, the end of the blatant anti-Semitic acts in the consortium seems farther than it should. If we wish to seek a peaceful solution to the Arab-Israel conflict, as I do, then we must work together to encourage fruitful, respectful dialogue while fostering a safer place for every Claremont College student to show his or her identity proudly. But it starts with drawing clear boundaries between anti-Semitism and anti-Zionism. I will not stand idly by as the same hateful ideology that sent my people through gas chambers and pogroms mix with an opposition to the actions of a free democracy. Such conflations are baseless and have no place anywhere, especially on college campuses.\u000a________________\u000aCORRECTION: The sentence \u201cWhen discussing Jewish faith and culture, we talk about how our cultures share the same texts, the same language, the same core values, but our differences lie in dialects, customs, food, and, most notably, land of origin.\u201d has been changed to: \u201cWhen discussing Jewish faith and culture, we talk about how our cultures differ in dialects, customs, and food, but we all share the same texts, the same language, the same core values, and, most notably, land of origin.\u201d\u000aImage Source: Wikimedia\u000aShare this:Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)MoreClick to print (Opens in new window)Click to share on Pinterest (Opens in new window)Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)Click to share on Google+ (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Tags: Anti-Semitism Anti-Zionism Claremont Colleges CMC Hate Crimes Israel Jewish StudentsCategories: Opinion

aS'2014 Inland Empire Economic Forecast Conference Recap'
p963
aVWhat\u2019s the current state of the Inland Empire recovery, and where does the region go from here? These were two of the main questions answered by Manfred Keil, associate professor of economics at the Robert Day School of Economics and Finance at Claremont McKenna College, at the fifth annual Inland Empire Economic Forecast Conference.\u000aManfred Keil, associate professor of economics, Claremont McKenna College, gives the Inland Empire forecast during the 5th annual Economic Forecast Conference at the Citizens Business Bank Arena in Ontario, Ca., Wednesday, October 29, 2014. (Jennifer Cappuccio Maher/Inland Valley Daily Bulletin)\u000aWith regards to the current state of the recovery, Keil had good news to tell the audience of 650 at the Citizens Business Bank Arena in Ontario, CA. The headline for his presentation was the fact that the number of jobs in the Inland Empire has finally recovered, if one takes into account individuals who live in the Inland Empire but commute to neighboring counties to work. Keil also told the conference that the current projected unemployment rate of 8.7% in the Inland Empire would fall to 5.5% by December 2016. However, Keil underlined the fact that the job recovery might not be as good of news as one might initially think. Keil stated that, while \u201cgrowth in employment has been going well,\u201d \u201cthe kinds of jobs that have been generated now are not of the highest quality.\u201d Specifically, he said that \u201cwe have replaced jobs in construction and manufacturing in particular with jobs in leisure and hospitality and, to an even larger extent, in education and health, and those are not as high-paying as the ones before.\u201d Therefore, moving forward, the challenge is how one might bring higher paying jobs into the Inland Empire.\u000aBoth Keil and Edward Leamer, economics professor at UCLA and director of the UCLA Anderson Forecast, underlined the need for a more educated workforce in the Inland Empire. Currently, according John Husing, chief economist for the Inland Empire Economic Partnership, only 20.1% of people in the Inland Empire have an bachelor\u2019s degree or higher. This statistic is stark in contrast with figures of 30.1% for Los Angeles County and 37.1% for Orange County. Keil stated that \u201cwe have to make the area attractive to businesses to come here, and I think the only way to do this is to have a better educated labor force that will be highly productive.\u201d Leamer agreed, stating that \u201cwe don\u2019t have a workforce that is suited to the post-industrial age. Now, the problem with workforce development is it takes a couple of decades to get a kid ready for a high-quality job, but we as a nation need to recognize that investment in our kids in the No.1 job of our parents and grandparents.\u201d\u000aIn addition to a better-educated workforce, Keil offered a few recommendations to policymakers in the Inland Empire to bring back manufacturing jobs that were lost during the Great Recession. Among his recommendations were tax credits and special economic zones that would create incentives for manufacturers to return to the region. Keil stated that he believes that policymakers need to \u201cgive the manufacturer some incentive to locate here initially. There\u2019s always the talk about loosening environmental regulations, and I\u2019m never quite sure of what to make of it. I\u2019m sure regulation here is heavy, but that did not deter people in the past from coming here. There are so many reasons why people want to come to Southern California.\u201d On a side note, Keil also recommended that policymakers stay away from raising the minimum wage in the region, as \u201cincreasing the minimum wage would have a detrimental effect on the continuing growth of the leisure and hospitality sector.\u201d\u000aTo learn more about Claremont McKenna College\u2019s Inland Empire Center, visit inlandempirecenter.org.\u000aShare this:Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)MoreClick to print (Opens in new window)Click to share on Pinterest (Opens in new window)Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)Click to share on Google+ (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Tags: Claremont McKenna College CMC economy Inland Empire Manfred KeilCategories: Feature

aS'The Elephants\xe2\x80\x99 Charge: Voters Nationwide Stampede to GOP'
p967
aVThe February 2014 cover story of the Claremont Independent, \u201c2014: Year of the Elephant,\u201d boldly asserted that Republicans would win big in the midterm elections. The article was met with widespread contempt across the 5Cs. Multiple copies of the issue were visibly ripped apart on the Scripps campus. A columnist for The Student Life publicly ridiculed the \u201clarge elephant on the cover.\u201d The backlash was so severe that former CI Editor-in-Chief Brad Richardson even issued an editorial response titled \u201cIn Defense of the Independent.\u201d\u000aAs it turns out, Republicans have obtained an historic majority in the House of Representatives, will likely pick up nine seats in the Senate, and have even managed to achieve a net gain in governorships by winning in the solidly blue states of Illinois, Massachusetts, and Maryland. It would be tempting to sit back, write an article telling the 5Cs \u201cwe told you so,\u201d and bask in the glory of these midterm results; however, it is perhaps more constructive to reflect on how the Republicans won as opposed to just how many seats they won.\u000aRepublican Governor-elect Greg Abbott (TX)\u000aOne of the most significant takeaways from the 2014 midterm elections is the fact that voters realized Democrats\u2019 accusation that Republicans are waging a \u201cWar on Women\u201d is simply a political tactic, divorced from reality. In the Colorado Senate race, incumbent Democrat Mark Udall made women\u2019s issues the crux of his campaign (so much so he was given the nickname \u201cMark Uterus\u201d), yet he still lost to conservative Republican Cory Gardner. Feminist icon Wendy Davis lost the Texas gubernatorial election to Greg Abbott by over 20 points, even losing the women\u2019s vote by a considerable margin.\u000aRepublican Senator-elect Joni Ernst (IA)\u000aThe number of Republican women elected to office in 2014 is even more indicative of how the \u201cWar on Women\u201d is a farce. Joni Ernst of Iowa and Shelley Moore Capito of West Virginia will become the first female senators from their respective states. Nikki Haley of South Carolina, Mary Fallin of Oklahoma, and Susana Martinez of New Mexico all won their gubernatorial re-election bids and ensured that their husbands will remain the First Gentleman of their respective states.\u000aRepublican Senator Tim Scott (SC)\u000aRepublican Congresswoman-elect Mia Love (UT)\u000aThe 2014 midterms also dismantled the notion that the Republican Party electorate won\u2019t vote for minority candidates. Tim Scott of South Carolina (where the Civil War began) became the first African-American to be elected to the Senate in the South since the Reconstruction Era. Likewise, Will Hurd of Texas defeated a Democratic incumbent to become the first black U.S. Representative from the state since Reconstruction. Most notably, Mia Love of Utah will become the first black female Republican in Congress.\u000aRepublican Governor Brian Sandoval (NV)\u000aRepublicans are also demonstrating considerable success in their outreach to the Hispanic community. Governor Brian Sandoval won re-election in the swing state of Nevada by an astounding 46 points and is considered a potential candidate in the 2016 senate election against Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid.\u000aRepublican Governor Susana Martinez (NM)\u000aAfter becoming the first Hispanic female governor in 2011, Susana Martinez trounced her Democratic opponent by 14 points. While many Democratic operatives salivate at the prospect of Texas becoming a blue state (thus dealing Republicans a huge blow in the Electoral College), Republican senator John Cornyn won re-election with 48 percent of the Hispanic vote (compared to 47 percent for his opponent) according to the Pew Research Center.\u000aWith its enormous gains in both the House and Senate, the GOP has undoubtedly asserted itself in a forceful way on the national scene. Yet, what is perhaps even more indicative of a nationwide Republican revolution is the GOP\u2019s dominance at the state level. Republicans now control 31 out of 50 governorships and 69 out of 99 state legislative bodies (including complete control of 29 state legislatures). This means that the Republican Party will be setting the legislative agenda at both the state and federal levels.\u000aThis unquestionably dominant GOP performance alludes to a more poignant, harrowing reality for Democrats: the strategy of class warfare and race/gender-based division is incompatible with the 21st century. No longer can Democrats use scare tactics and divide the electorate into groups of the \u201coppressed\u201d (women, minorities, the poor, gays) and the \u201coppressors\u201d (men, white people, the rich, Christians). This strategy didn\u2019t work for Mark Udall, and it failed miserably for Wendy Davis.\u000aAccording to exit polls, 70 percent of Americans indicated that the economy and healthcare were their primary voting issues. People simply don\u2019t have time to worry about fictitious oppression narratives when they are trying to find a job or have lost their health insurance. In the hyper-insulated, overwhelmingly liberal 5C environment, it is easy to lose track of these mainstream issues that are foremost in the minds of the majority of Americans.\u000aWe realize that most students at the 5Cs will probably scoff at the aforementioned results and disregard the underlying trends. Instead, they will likely attribute the GOP victory to the evil Koch brothers using dark money to corrupt politicians and buy the election (they will want you to ignore the political spending of liberal billionaires George Soros and Tom Steyer). They will also complain of angry voter sentiment held by old white people who flocked to the polls out of a personal hatred for Obama (once again, wanting you to ignore the GOP\u2019s performance among women and minorities).\u000aThe Claremont Independent highlighted in its Oct. 27 article, entitled \u201cWho\u2019s the Fairest of Them All,\u201d that 71 percent of CMC, 92 percent of Pomona, and 96 percent of Pitzer students prefer the Democratic Party. The Golden Antlers was quick to point out that the Claremont Independent was the \u201clast to see elephant in the room, college students are mostly liberal.\u201d However, we at the CI like to think that our February cover story shows we were in fact the first at the 5Cs to see the real elephant in the room: the GOP is stampeding across the nation.\u000aElephant Image Source: Earth Touch/Flickr\u000aPoliticians\u2019 photos taken from their respective Facebook profiles\u000aShare this:Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)MoreClick to print (Opens in new window)Click to share on Pinterest (Opens in new window)Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)Click to share on Google+ (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Tags: Conservatism election GOP Republican Republican Party The Student LifeCategories: Opinion

aS'12 Best Photos From Friday\xe2\x80\x99s ROTC Drill'
p971
aVOn Friday, November 14th, Claremont\u2019s Reserve Officer Training Corps (ROTC) cadets took part in a Rehearsal of Concept (ROC) drill alongside cadets from Cal Poly Pomona and Azusa Pacific University in preparation for next weekend\u2019s Leadership Training Exercises (LTX) at Camp Pendleton.\u000aThe cadets went over their plans for the LTX and then ran through four different missions, or \u201clanes\u201d (with two squads separately running through each lane). Cadets practiced their critical thinking, ethical decision-making, and communications skills, among others, as they spent the afternoon going through these exercises.\u000aThe Claremont Independent was the only publication that covered Friday\u2019s ROC drill. Here are twelve of the best photos from the ROC drill.\u000aView the entire album on our Facebook page.\u000aCadet Benjamin Waldman CMC \u201915 (left) is the Executive Officer (senior-most cadet) of the Golden Lions Battalion.\u000aEven the shooting range has its own detailed floor map. Safety is a major concern for next weekend. It\u2019ll be the first FTX for the first-year cadets and many cadets\u2019 first exposure to weapons.\u000aClaremont ROTC Cadets pick up their \u201crubber duckies,\u201d dummy rifles.\u000aClaremont, Cal Poly Pomona, and Azusa Pacific University ROTC cadets at attention, now carrying their \u201crubber duckies.\u201d\u000aCadets are taught to respect the villagers\u2019 culture so long as it does not unduly risk their safety. For instance, the cadets are taught to allow villagers to invade their personal space since many non-Western cultures have different concepts of personal space.\u000aThe village elder\u2019s son appears out of the house. Is he a threat?\u000aAs the cadets approach the house, \u201cBoom\u201d an IED explodes, killing Cadet Ashburn. Everything changes.\u000aThe cadets wrestle the village elder to the ground. Everyone is yelling. The elder\u2019s son raises his weapon and shouts at the cadets.\u000aThe cadets hesitate to shoot. For what feels like an eternity, the cadets aim their dummy rifles at the elder\u2019s son while he threatens to kill them and holds up his rifle. They yell back and forth with him until Cadet Schmidt takes the shot. \u201cBang.\u201d It\u2019s over.\u000aThe commanding officer for the second squad going through the second mission simulation is female. In order to respect village customs, she requires not only an interpreter but also a male interlocutor. It causes confusion, making communication and successful completion of the mission all the more difficult.\u000aThe elder is in a state of duress. The two men with guns outside his home are holding him and his family hostage. The HVT is located inside the elder\u2019s home, which again is guarded by these two men.\u000aCadets enter the village elder\u2019s home, in search of the High Value Target (HVT) inside.\u000a \u000aShare this:Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)MoreClick to print (Opens in new window)Click to share on Pinterest (Opens in new window)Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)Click to share on Google+ (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Tags: CMC ROTCCategories: Feature

aS'A Free Market Defense of Plan B Vending Machines'
p975
aVBy Chris Gaarder and Hannah Oh\u000aHere at the Claremont Independent, we aim to kindle meaningful discussion by introducing less commonly held views on a variety of campus issues. In his latest opinion piece, Harry Arnold \u201817 expresses his views on the promotion of Pomona\u2019s Plan B vending machine and its negative moral and social implications. However, we argue that, from an economic standpoint, there is a strong free market case to be made in defense of vending machines that sell Plan B, among other medical supplies, on America\u2019s college campuses.\u000aPlan B is a prime example of the near-infinite problems bedeviling our nation\u2019s health care market, particularly when it comes to drug policy. Medical vending machines exemplify the positive changes occurring in America\u2019s healthcare landscape in spite of federal policy.\u000aOn the whole, drugs are far too expensive and inaccessible for the average consumer. Part of this is due to the elaborate regulations and bureaucratic red tape promulgated by the federal Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The high cost of getting a new drug approved by the FDA is outrageous. Forbes has determined that it costs, on average, $350 million to get a new drug through the FDA to the market. Who pays for that? It isn\u2019t the drug companies. Instead, the cost is shifted onto consumers directly, or indirectly through higher insurance premiums and taxes to cover those on government-provided health insurance programs.\u000aWhen Plan B first came out as an over-the-counter drug, it cost up to $90 and averaged around $50. How were those prices set? It\u2019s hard to tell due to our country\u2019s historical lack of price transparency and competition for medical goods and services. When you go to your pharmacist or your doctor, you pay whatever price they set. And the system is built against allowing consumers to shop around. With all the distortions and opacity in the healthcare market, these prices are often arbitrary and highly inflated. Some people don\u2019t mind paying a higher price, but most price-conscious consumers would prefer to pay less.\u000aToday we are in the midst of one of the first major shifts of market forces into healthcare. If allowed to continue, it could prove to be the best thing that ever happened to healthcare, and Corporate America is leading the way.\u000aIn recent years, big-box retail corporations have realized that there is serious money to be made in providing health care services and products, ranging from simple flu shots to a wide range of prescription drugs. Target, for example, utilizes its immense purchasing power, operating efficiency, and tight profit margin to deliver the same drugs as pharmacies and hospitals at a much lower price.\u000aTransparent store prices breed competition on factors including price, quality, and convenience. Unlike with pharmacies and hospitals, consumers who buy drugs at chain stores, such as Target, Rite-Aid, or WalMart, are able to easily compare among the various providers to find the best price. On college campuses, vending machines provide yet another source of competition for over-the-counter drugs.\u000aVending machines for Plan B are an innovative way to provide around-the-clock access and competitive pricing. With vending machines, no direct intermediary is necessary for purchase. You simply insert money and receive your desired product, at any time of day (especially important given the time-sensitive nature of Plan B). Vending machines also provide college students a level of convenience similar to what big box retailers provide real-world consumers. Convenience is valuable itself, a non-monetary form of competition.\u000aBy providing emergency contraception via vending machines, colleges are more efficiently meeting student demand. The Pomona College administration did not invent the Plan B vending machine: the Associated Students of Pomona College (ASPC) played an integral role in introducing the concept and formalizing the final proposal. The desire for a vending machine that distributes Plan B arose from students concerned that the drug is not available at night or over the weekend. Student Health Services, the only Plan B provider on campus, is closed during those times. To address this shortcoming, Pomona students initiated a viable solution that won widespread support.\u000aStudents at Claremont McKenna College are only now engaging in a meaningful discussion about Pomona\u2019s policy change, and that\u2019s because of Harry\u2019s article. His article promotes one of the many perspectives that exist among right-leaning students. His is more conservative, ours more libertarian.\u000aThe Claremont Independent staff remains divided on this issue, but we hope that, in any case, we are able to spark a thoughtful dialogue on campus, perhaps beyond Plan B, vending machines, and Skittles, that sheds further light on the morality of commoditizing emergency contraception, the social consequences of our college hookup culture, and the economic fundamentals behind improving student access.\u000aShare this:Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)MoreClick to print (Opens in new window)Click to share on Pinterest (Opens in new window)Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)Click to share on Google+ (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Tags: Conservatism Health Care Libertarianism Plan B Pomona RebuttalCategories: Opinion Rebuttal

aS'An Uneven Playing Field'
p979
aVWhen I played soccer growing up, the coin toss was the most important part of the game. The coin toss determined which team shot on which goal during the first half, and my teammates and I knew that this was a critical factor in determining who would emerge victorious at the end of our sixty-minute game: the field we played on was heavily slanted so that one goal was downhill relative to the other goal, and was therefore much easier to score on. Soccer is a low-scoring game, and it\u2019s very rare for a team to build up the momentum to come back from behind to win the game. This meant that scoring the first goal was a must, and as such, it was essential to win the coin toss if we wanted to win the game.\u000aLooking back, I find it troublesome that the coin toss, a seemingly insignificant event, was able to serve as such an accurate predictor of the outcome of our games. All of the fancy dribbling, well-placed corner kicks, and diving headers, no matter how spectacular, were not enough to overcome the effects of the coin toss. One team scores all of its goals in the first half, and the other team scores all of its goals in the second half. There is no back-and-forth, no change in lead. Essentially, all of the excitement and competitiveness of the game is taken away. Most importantly, the coin toss was only relevant due to the lack of a level playing field.\u000aWhen I arrived in college last year, I noticed a similar phenomenon on my campus. I recall one day in particular when, as I was scrolling through my Facebook news feed, I came across an advertisement for a party that Kappa Delta, one of the fraternities at my school, was throwing. They described the event as an America- themed party, where partygoers would attend dressed in red, white, and blue, in what the fraternity members described as a celebration of patriotism. It didn\u2019t sound like anything special to me. KD threw similar parties (albeit with different themes) just about every week, and I didn\u2019t usually go anyway.\u000aThe night of that party, I managed to get my schoolwork done early, so I decided I\u2019d stop by. When I returned to my room after swim practice, I looked at the KD Facebook page to check the time of the party. When the page loaded, I was perplexed by what I saw. A series of angry comments, many of which were well over 500 words, had been posted in response to the description of the party. These comments claimed that the party was \u201cinsensitive and indirectly promoted imperialism, violence, and racist power structures,\u201d as written in The Student Life, the newspaper for my college and four others nearby.\u000aMany students seemed to feel that because of the problems in the United States\u2019 past, it was wrong to celebrate their native country. The commenters on the Facebook page pointed out such tragedies as the Ku Klux Klan, Islamophobia, and white supremacy as reasons that it should be unacceptable to host an America- themed party. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s an argument to be made that parties in support of the Ku Klux Klan, Islamophobia, or white supremacy are acceptable. However, I think these students\u2019 concerns were misplaced. I don\u2019t believe that honoring the US suggests that one supports everything that everyone who has ever lived in the US has ever done. No country is perfect, and somebody who supports his or her home nation is not necessarily implying that he or she supports a patriarchal system of imperial domination. To assume this is as unfair as using a single coin toss, ignoring all of the other events on the field over the course of the game, to determine its outcome.\u000aA handful of fairly well-known websites came across the story of Pomona\u2019s America Party, and their perspective on the situation was essentially a more extreme version of mine. Barstool U, a blog written by and for college students, displayed some of the more elaborate complaints my classmates had posted on the KD page, and made mocking comments criticizing their validity by writing things along the lines of \u201cSeriously you got to love to anti-America anti-Imperialism outrage coming from a private residential liberal arts college in California.\u201d Additionally, turtleboysports, a similar blog, went down a comparable list of comments that had been posted and pointed out the areas that it believed were ridiculous. Turtleboysports took things a step further, though, by adding embarrassing photos they had dug up on Facebook of the commenters they were riffing. The students who were the subjects of these blog posts insisted this was a violation of their privacy and took their frustration to the administration.\u000aThough I recognize that my college was only trying to stand up for the students who felt humiliated, I was unimpressed with the school\u2019s response. Upset by the fact that external bloggers had been making fun of Pomona students, the Deans ultimately pressured the members of Kappa Delta into sending out a mass apology to the student body. It made no sense to me that Kappa Delta was forced to apologize for the actions of people who were entirely independent from them. What happened was not their fault, and was entirely beyond their control. In the apology, they wrote:\u000a\u201cOn Monday night Kappa Delta published a description for an event called \u2018America Pub,\u2019 which can still be found below for reference. That description was not only exclusionary, but condoned war and implicitly suggested that Kappa Delta supports all US policies, past and present, including those which have deprived human beings of basic rights and freedoms. As your classmates and peers, we, the brothers of Kappa Delta, sincerely apologize for the thoughtless nature of the event description, which does not reflect the standard we hold ourselves to.\u201d\u000aWhile the party was allowed to continue, it was clear that it was not welcome. Students angrily protesting the party\u2019s theme vastly outnumbered those who were just hoping to head over to Dom\u2019s Lounge and relax. Anyone who wore clothing with stars and stripes on it was subject to ridicule. Needless to say, the party didn\u2019t last very long.\u000aI was appalled by the events of that night. I certainly don\u2019t believe that anyone should be forced to celebrate America, but I also don\u2019t believe that anyone should be forced not to. There are not many countries in the world where one has the right to freedom of speech, and I\u2019m fortunate to live in one of them. However, I fear that this freedom is waning, particularly on college campuses.\u000aPomona College, like many similar schools, is quick to point out its commitment to diversity on campus. I\u2019m a huge supporter of diversity, as I believe different perspectives coming together are what inspire innovation. In my opinion, the best way to learn about something or develop an idea is to hear the outlook of a person who thinks differently than you do.\u000aUnfortunately, Pomona\u2019s commitment to diversity does not extend to diversity of ideas. This is most obvious when considering controversial current events. Politically, I identify as a moderate. At Pomona, this seems to mean my opinions are not worth hearing. Any time I offer a minority perspective on a complicated issue, my thoughts are immediately dismissed. My opinions, as well as those of anyone whose stance is in his/her community\u2019s minority, are silenced. I\u2019ve learned a lot from my classmates over the past year, for which I\u2019m very thankful. I think my classmates would be glad to learn from people whose opinions differ from their own as well, and as such I wish there were more open discourse on my campus.\u000aWhat I believe is the biggest problem on college campuses nationwide, based on the collective experiences of my friends and myself, is the increasingly one-sided presentation of information. At Pomona, I\u2019ve noticed that there is limited freedom of speech for those whose opinions are \u201cmore conservative.\u201d At other schools, there is limited freedom of speech for those whose opinions are different from whatever their school\u2019s majority is, whether it\u2019s \u201ctoo liberal,\u201d or \u201ctoo religious,\u201d or \u201cpro-choice\u201d or any number of things. I don\u2019t care whether someone agrees with me or not. Everyone should have the right to say what they believe and engage in a discussion with their peers. In college, it\u2019s our job to learn how to think, not what to think. It\u2019s impossible for a judge to form a decision after hearing only one side of the story.\u000aShare this:Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)MoreClick to print (Opens in new window)Click to share on Pinterest (Opens in new window)Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)Click to share on Google+ (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Tags: America Fairness Political Correctness Political Diversity PomonaCategories: Opinion

aS'You Want Some Plan B With Those Skittles?'
p983
aVOn September 18th CMC students received an email glorifying a new vending machine in Pomona\u2019s Walker Hall Lounge. The machine, which is accessible to students from all the 5Cs, is subtly located on the second floor of the lounge. While the machine does offer innocuous items such as Neosporin and aspirin, it also features a multitude of sexual health products, ranging from condoms and KY jelly to male vibrators. Most notably, students now have 24/7 access to the form of birth control known as Plan B, or the morning after pill.\u000a5C students have long been able to purchase Plan B from the Student Health Center without having to schedule an appointment beforehand. However, college vending machines that dispense the morning after pill are a novel concept. Just over a year ago in January of 2013, the FDA permitted Shippensburg University in Pennsylvania to continue offering Plan B in vending machines on campus. Pomona College is very likely one of the few colleges in the country to offer this type of resource to students.\u000aThe Claremont Colleges are undoubtedly a melting pot for socially liberal causes. Last spring, Pitzer College Senate seriously debated adopting a resolution to permit public nudity on campus. This fall CMC shed its image as a LGBT \u201cpariah\u201d and now offers a gender-neutral housing option for students. The Queer Resource Center recently sponsored a \u201cKink 101 Workshop\u201d that was held on September 27th. Suffice it to say that Pomona\u2019s recent decision to institute a Plan B vending machine comes as no big surprise.\u000aAs a socially conservative student, I fundamentally disagree with all of the aforementioned policy changes, for both moral and religious reasons. However, this does not necessarily mean that I would blindly impose my personal beliefs on others and call for the abolition of these resources and events. I value individual liberty, and believe people should have the autonomy to govern their own lifestyles. However, I do take issue with CMC\u2019s embrace of this latest liberal crusade.\u000aThe email from CMC\u2019s Dean of Students Office introducing the vending machine was filled with bias. Whether it was the opening line of \u201cI am pleased to announce another new resource available to you!\u201d or the proclamation that \u201cPomona College has graciously opened up this resource to students from all of the colleges,\u201d it was implicitly evident where DOS stood on the issue.\u000aWhat was perhaps even more surprising was how the email casually included Plan B in the list of products available in the new vending machine. It was as if DOS was completely oblivious to the fact that offering products such as Plan B and vibrators was a drastic change in policy for any college.\u000aThe administration\u2019s nonchalant introduction of the new Plan B vending machine is indicative of a larger problem that plagues college campuses: the voice of prudence and reason is too often compromised at the expense of the latest liberal social experiment. We should have a rigorous, meaningful discussion regarding such a drastic change in policy before it is prematurely declared to be a positive force on campus.\u000aWhen a female makes the decision to use Plan B, she accepts the possibility that she is preventing a fertilized egg from being implanted on the uterine wall. Individuals who believe life begins at conception equate this to abortion, a viewpoint that was recently legitimized by the Supreme Court in the Hobby Lobby case.\u000aThe permanent and irreversible nature of using Plan B affords no room for regret. This means that students who view Plan B as a form of abortion (or eventually come to hold this view), yet decide to use it anyway, may potentially subject themselves to emotional distress in the future. This is not an unfathomable scenario, as one\u2019s life-outlook is often radically different at age forty as opposed to age twenty.\u000aUsing Plan B also carries serious health considerations. The morning after pill is not a typical over-the-counter medication like Advil or Tylenol. It is a highly concentrated dose of hormones that can significantly alter a female\u2019s menstrual cycle. Dr. David Grimes, who spoke before an FDA advisory committee in 2003, said that, \u201cRepeated use of EC wreaks havoc on a woman\u2019s cycle.\u201d\u000aThe 24/7 access afforded by a vending machine is a dangerous proposition. The resulting effect is that students will no longer be bound by the time constraints of having to obtain Plan B from the Student Health Center or a local pharmacy. Assuming that most sexual activity occurs at night, students are usually forced to at least wait until the next morning to obtain and subsequently use Plan B. The instant accessibility of the vending machine will decrease the likelihood that students will consider the aforementioned consequences of using emergency contraception.\u000aRegardless of whether you believe Plan B is morally permissible, the decision to use the morning after pill should not be made lightly. This is why a vending machine that dispenses Plan B is a disservice to students. It inherently trivializes what should be a very serious decision.\u000aCMC\u2019s decision to support Pomona\u2019s new Plan B vending machine is more than just the college taking a firm stance on a highly divisive issue. CMC is compromising its students\u2019 ability to make safe, informed choices regarding a serious health issue. But in the midst of all the kink workshops, calls for public nudity, and efforts to nullify gender classification, who has time to notice?\u000aShare this:Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)MoreClick to print (Opens in new window)Click to share on Pinterest (Opens in new window)Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)Click to share on Google+ (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Tags: CMC Plan B PomonaCategories: Opinion

aS'The Scripps Silence: A Rebuttal to the Scripps Voice'
p991
aVThe Scripps Voice, the official student newspaper of Scripps College, came out in support of the college\u2019s decision to suppress the voices of those on campus with whom it disagrees.\u000aGeorge Will\u000aIn its Oct. 16 issue, the newspaper featured a breathtakingly laudatory editorial in response to the Scripps administration\u2019s decision to disinvite conservative columnist George Will from speaking on campus over a June 6 column that he wrote about sexual assault.\u000a\u201cThe Scripps Voice stands behind \u2013 and applauds \u2013 the College\u2019s decision,\u201d the editorial reads.\u000aThe newspaper makes several arguments regarding why the college was justified in rescinding Will\u2019s invitation to speak.\u000aFirst, the editorial claims that \u201csexual assault is a bipartisan issue\u201d about which there is no room for reasonable disagreement. On its face, there is some truth to this argument. Sexual assault is absolutely not a political question in the same way that, for instance, abortion is. Conservatives and liberals generally disagree about whether abortion is an inherently evil act, whereas both sides believe that sexual assault is always wrong.\u000aBut Will clearly was not arguing about the moral merits and detriments of the actual act of sexual assault in his column. Rather, he wrote about which acts deserve to be given the very serious label of \u201csexual assault,\u201d which cultural institutions (or lack thereof) sexual assault is most prevalent under, and what our judicial response to sexual assault should be. These are questions surely up for political debate and discussion \u2013 ones about which conservative and liberal principles and philosophy are generally in disagreement.\u000aThus, Will was disinvited from speaking on campus because of his conservative views toward the issue sexual assault \u2013 in a guest lecture series designed to promote conservative views on campus \u2013 because the Scripps College administration personally disagreed with those political views.\u000aIt should also be instructional that only liberals and progressives are using the \u201csexual assault is a bipartisan issue\u201d line. Where are the conservatives making the supposedly bipartisan argument that there is no room to disagree about political questions tangentially related to sexual assault?\u000aSecond, the editorial argues that allowing Will to speak after writing such a column would be harmful to the Scripps community, as it would trigger the past traumas of sexual assault survivors.\u000aYet, the Voice fails to mention that the only reason they are writing about Will\u2019s column is because the Scripps administration chose to disinvite him from speaking on campus. Many people on this campus \u2013 perhaps among them survivors of sexual assault \u2013 only read Will\u2019s initial column because of the political brouhaha that ensued after the disinvitation was revealed.\u000aWill\u2019s column would not have been required reading had he simply been allowed to come and speak on campus, nor would attendance at the talk have been mandatory, and it is very likely that the only mention of sexual assault would have been during the Q&A session. It can be argued that the Scripps administration did more to trigger past traumas by rescinding Will\u2019s invitation than they would have by letting him speak. (Of course, in its defense, the administration was probably counting on nobody finding out about the disinvitation.)\u000aThird, and most fallaciously, the editorial argues that, because Will\u2019s First Amendment rights were not violated by the disinvitation, he was not really \u201ccensored.\u201d\u000aAside from the fact that no one is claiming that Will\u2019s First Amendment rights were violated, this is a very dubious argument \u2013 and a bit of a troubling one coming from a newspaper with the word \u201cvoice\u201d in its name. Perhaps it is best rebutted by a simple thought experiment.\u000aHypothetically speaking, were the Scripps administration to, say, take a stack of the most recent edition of the Scripps Voice and throw it into the trash, perhaps because it disagreed with one of the articles, would the Scripps Voice claim that they had been censored?\u000aOne need not think long on this question, because that is exactly what the newspaper claimed to have happened last year, when it intentionally left its Feb. 17 issue\u2019s front cover blank in order to protest \u201cstudent censorship\u201d on campus.\u000aIt is ridiculous to think that political censorship can only exist within the sphere of the First Amendment of the Constitution of the United States. Just because it is not an American governmental entity doing the censoring does not mean that one has not been censored.\u000aFinally, while the arguments raised by the Scripps Voice are far from persuasive, they are also straw men.\u000aThe real question up for debate here is not whether George Will expressed a conservative point of view, if what he wrote was insensitive, or if Scripps technically \u201ccensored\u201d him by rescinding his invitation from campus, but whether the university can fulfill its primary purpose of creating critical thinkers and responsible citizens by presenting only one side of any given argument.\u000aIs the modern-day university doing its students a disservice by shielding them from opinions about which they may disagree and that they may find hurtful? Can the academy properly function while only presenting certain acceptable points of view for debate and discussion?\u000aYou won\u2019t find out by reading the Scripps Voice.\u000aShare this:Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)MoreClick to print (Opens in new window)Click to share on Pinterest (Opens in new window)Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)Click to share on Google+ (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Tags: George Will Rebuttal Scripps Scripps Voice Sexual ViolenceCategories: Opinion Rebuttal

aS'Social Responsibility: A Pragmatic Solution'
p998
aVThere have been a lot of discussions on campus lately about social responsibility. Emails from the administration and ASCMC have been filling students\u2019 inboxes with a \u201csocial responsibility contract\u201d that supposedly represents the administration \u201cputting the ball back into our court.\u201d\u000aWith all the rhetoric that has been thrown around about \u201csocial responsibility,\u201d I contend that the administration has lost sight of the current social situation at CMC. It is absolutely ridiculous to expect students to be 100% responsible\u2014a term that now seems to be a code for straight-edge, abstinent, and sitting-in-your-room-and-never-doing-anything. Students at CMC have never claimed to be perfect, and no one should hold them to that standard.\u000aThe administration\u2019s call for social responsibility began this past March with the Mirza Summit on Personal and Social Responsibility that sought to address concerns regarding alcohol and substance abuse on CMC\u2019s campus. It is essential to note, however, that CMC has been incredibly safe by any standard of alcohol and drug misuse, especially compared to national statistics among other universities and colleges. Yes, it was tragic that Ali Mirza (CMC \u201815) passed away due to drug misuse, but is this one rare case enough to signify a culture of problematic drug abuse at CMC? Even if the administration believes that it signifies a fundamental shift in CMC\u2019s social scene (which is absolutely ludicrous), the only way that Mirza would have been saved is if CMC posted Campus Security officers in his dorm room before he partook in drug use. Of course, this type of solution is impractical (not to mention incredibly Orwellian), so the only thing that they can now do is crack down on the rest of the student body for a single incident that did not have anything to do with our \u201cproblem culture.\u201d\u000aI do not think it is necessary for me to cover the changes in the CMC social scene that have occurred over the past couple years because it is so evident every time a student goes out on a Thursday or Saturday night. However, it honestly seems like the administration does not know how their recent actions have changed the social scene, so I will spell it out for them. Students are now completely put off by registered parties because they know that they will have to pass through a checkpoint to enter into a fenced space with low-volume music (we don\u2019t want to cause a noise complaint, especially since we are surrounded by four other colleges) while they are being eyeballed by Campus Security and any number of Deans, staff, or RA\u2019s. These sorts of over-controlling and intrusive actions have the direct cause of making students rebellious as they resent to be labelled as vagrants and trouble-makers for wanting to go out and socialize with friends. Students have, therefore, become increasingly likely to binge drink (or use other drugs) before the registered party because they know they will not be able to have any sort of fun in an environment that is excessively puritanized by the administration.\u000aSince the administration seems laughably inept at fostering the sort of fun, inclusive, and positive social atmosphere that used to define CMC, let me throw out a few recommendations that will stop this cycle of self-destruction.\u000aFirst off, stop fencing and posting an ever increasing amount of Camp Sec officers at every single social event. This will allow a more organic social atmosphere to take over at registered parties. Suddenly, they will become more \u201ccool\u201d as students feel less violated (for lack of a better word) for wanting to hang out with friends. This will, consequently, lessen the need for students to binge on drinks or drugs before a party, leading to exactly the lowering in \u201clegal liability\u201d that the CMC administration wants to see.\u000aSecondly, stop sending condescending communications to the students. Instead of talking down to the student body, let them know that you will help them if they make a mistake or lose their way during college. Students do not start a night of partying with friends hoping to go to hospital. Typically, they make the mistake of getting caught up in the moment and drinking too much without realizing it. The administration should, therefore, help students get better and then offer additional support if they need/ask for it. They should not, under any circumstance, talk down to these students or punish the student body for the mistake of one human being (who is as imperfect as any one of us).\u000aThirdly, do not use the phrase \u201csocial responsibility\u201d when talking to students about your utopian vision of CMC. I strongly believe that social responsibility means taking responsibility of one\u2019s actions as a human being in the social sphere. That means admitting, \u201cYes, I did drink too much last night\u201d when one is transported to hospital, and asking for help and support from family, friends, and the administration afterwards. It does not, under any circumstance, mean that students should be held to an impossible standard of puritanism by the administration.\u000aI sincerely hope that this article will resonate with students at CMC and show the administration that there is another way to challenge the misguided norms regarding \u201csocial responsibility\u201d set by other colleges around the nation. The recommendations I set above might seem to go against everything the deans now stand for, but I believe it is a better solution than a seemingly inevitable downward spiral into the abyss of excessive administration intrusion into students\u2019 lives and students responding with alcohol/drug overuse. Maybe, just maybe, our example could make other colleges rethink their own policies and lead to a fundamental shift in attitudes towards how students should be treated.\u000aShare this:Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)MoreClick to print (Opens in new window)Click to share on Pinterest (Opens in new window)Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)Click to share on Google+ (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Tags: ASCMC Campus Culture Campus Safety CMC social responsibilityCategories: Opinion

aVFor most Americans, the mid-term elections are a non-event. Without the fanfare and national messaging of a presidential race, voters are generally less engaged and turn out at a rate about 20 percentage points lower than on a presidential election year. However, this election year is an important one. With no presidential race, the important elections are for the Senate, which could turn Republican for the first time since 2008. The Democrats are especially vulnerable in this cycle, not only because of President Obama\u2019s approval ratings, which are in the low 40s, but also because they have more seats in play than the GOP, at 21 to 15. In addition, of the 15 GOP seats, 12 are considered \u201csafe\u201d by political handicappers. By comparison, only 7 of the Democrats\u2019 21 are considered \u201csafe,\u201d while another one of their seats, in Montana, is actually considered safe for Republicans. Currently, 8 Democratic seats are involved in competitive races, half of which are currently tilted towards a GOP victory.\u000aUltimately, Republicans will need a net gain of 6 seats or more to retake the Senate. In addition to Montana, the GOP will probably take a Democratic seat in West Virginia, where Congresswoman Shelley Moore Capito was leading Secretary of State Natalie Tennant by 17 points. The GOP is also slated to pick up a seat in South Dakota, where Mike Rounds, a former Governor leads Independent Larry Pressler a former GOP Senator, and Democrat Rick Weiland, a businessman, by 15 and 10 points, respectively. In addition to those three, Republicans will need to pick up at least 3 of 6 competitive Democratic seats. The best opportunity for the GOP is in Arkansas where Tom Cotton, a congressman and decorated veteran of Iraq and Afghanistan, faces incumbent Mark Pryor. Cotton\u2019s advantage comes from both Arkansas\u2019 political inclination and President Obama\u2019s unpopularity, especially with regards to the Affordable Care Act (ACA). This pattern is consistent for most vulnerable Democrats, who are attempting to distance themselves from the unpopular ACA and president and trying to make the campaign about social issues, such as abortion and same-sex marriage, which the GOP has struggled with in the past. In addition to the ACA, vulnerable Democrats have been trying to distance themselves from the President\u2019s energy agenda, as 3 very competitive races are in energy producing states, including Mary Landrieu in Louisiana, Mark Begich in Alaska, and Mark Udall in Colorado. For these three incumbents, winning depends on their ability to move the narrative away from the White House and Washington, and onto local issues. Iowa, another competitive race, is an unique case in the sense that it is competitive because the Democratic candidate, Congressman Bruce Braley, has been caught in a series of gaffes, including one where he was caught on video disparaging sitting Senator Chuck Grassley as \u201ca farmer from Iowa who never went to law school\u201d. This sort of gaffe, has made what was supposed to be an easy race for Democrats has become one of the most competitive in the country. The final competitive Democratic seat is Kay Hagan\u2019s in North Carolina, where she faces state Speaker of the House Thom Tillis. Tillis has attacked Hagan in a similar fashion to other Republicans, mainly based on her connection to Obama and other national Democrats. Hagan has responded by criticizing Tillis over controversial actions taken by the state legislature, including voter ID and abortion laws. Hagan currently has a small lead in the polls, leading Tillis by approximately 2 points.\u000aIn addition to picking up 6 seats, the GOP will need to defend 3 vulnerable seats. The most vulnerable is Pat Roberts in Kansas, who after a difficult primary, expected to have an easier general election campaign, as Independent Greg Orman and Democrat Chad Taylor were expected to split the Democratic vote. However, Taylor dropped out of the race in favor of Orman, who is now running level with Roberts. The other vulnerable Senator is Mitch McConnell, in Kentucky. While McConnell is predicted to win his race, his opponent, Secretary of State Alison Lundergan Grimes has poured a substantial amount of money into unseating the Minority Leader. National Republicans have responded by spending even more money to protect McConnell and attack Grimes. As a result, Kentucky has become one of the most expensive races this cycle, with both sides spending at least a combined $40 million thus far. Finally, the GOP needs to defend Saxby Chambliss\u2019 open seat in Georgia. The race features political newcomers from both parties, with a businessman, David Perdue, on the ticket for the GOP, and the CEO of a non-profit, Michelle Nunn, representing the Democrats. Perdue has a small lead in the polls, by about 3 points, but is ultimately expected to defeat Nunn in this Southern red state.\u000aAt this point, the GOP stands a fair chance of regaining control of the Senate, but changes in the national political scene in coming weeks could lead to them falling short, with Democrats maintaining a smaller majority, or even getting a rare 50-50 split, where Vice President Biden would then be frequently called upon to break ties. There are only a few weeks left before the nation finds out which it will be.\u000aShare this:Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)MoreClick to print (Opens in new window)Click to share on Pinterest (Opens in new window)Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)Click to share on Google+ (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Tags: Colin Spence Democrats National Politics Republicans U.S. SenateCategories: Feature

aVAs a conservative in an overwhelmingly liberal college environment, it can often be difficult to engage in intellectual discourse with like-minded individuals. Two CMC students, Cameron Ridley \u201915 and Kelsey Heflin \u201916, recognized this problem, as well as the conservative movement\u2019s inability to \u201cprovide an easily graspable alternative to the strong rhetoric of the Left.\u201d Together they established the CMC chapter of Young Americans for Freedom, a non-profit group devoted to advancing conservative ideas.\u000aThe Young Americans for Freedom, or YAF, sponsors conferences and connects its members with educational and career opportunities within the conservative community. According to Ridley, YAF \u201ctouts itself as a think tank that develops the ideas which politicians may then use to bolster their positions.\u201d The CMC chapter of YAF plans to organize activities including movie showings, debates, and participation in political campaigns.\u000a\u201cMembers also will receive the chance to attend funded YAF conferences, which provides good networking opportunities since it is affiliated with the larger national Young Americans Foundation. At the conferences, students will learn from top professors and leaders in the Conservative Movement and discover ways to champion conservative principles,\u201d Heflin said.\u000aBy attending conferences and other educational events, YAF members will be able to enhance the level of discourse within CMC classrooms as well as the wider 5C community. Although YAF is currently listed as an official CMC club, it welcomes members from all the Claremont Colleges.\u000a\u201cWe want to foster an environment where conservative-minded students can join and share ideas. We hope to promote conservative principles on campus and provide a place for free discussion and activism to occur among college students,\u201d Ridley said.\u000aAnyone interested in learning more about YAF or joining the CMC chapter can access the \u201cCMC Young Americans for Freedom\u201d Facebook page for meeting information and other opportunities.\u000aContact:\u000aCameron Ridley, Chairman: cridley15@cmc.edu\u000aKelsey Heflin, Vice-Chairman: kheflin16@cmc.edu\u000aUpcoming Meetings (5:45-6:25 pm in Kravis Center room 109):\u000a\u2013 Thursday, October 23, 2014\u000a\u2013 Thursday, October 30, 2014\u000a\u2013 Thursday, November 13, 2014\u000a\u2013 Thursday, November 27, 2014\u000a\u2013 Thursday, December 11, 2014

p1010
aVIn today\u2019s knowledge-based economy, higher education has become increasingly important in influencing social and economic prosperity. Unfortunately, education is an opportunity that is still not afforded to many. In an effort to alleviate this problem, colleges have tried to implement policies such as affirmative action to increase racial diversity. To increase socio-economic diversity, they have used tools such as Pell Grants and need blind admissions. In the TSL\u2019s \u201cA Tale of Two CMCs,\u201d Carlos Ballesteros argues that CMC has actively sought to exclude low-income minority students from the student body. Ballesteros points out that, as international student admission numbers have risen, the admission of low-income minority students has fallen. This is relevant since CMC does not offer any financial aid to international students outside of merit scholarships, implying that international students have financial means that many others do not. He also states that, as this change has occurred, the college has simultaneously ended relations with Quest Bridge and Posse (two highly selective scholarship programs for low-income minorities). This, Ballesteros argues, supports his belief that CMC is cynically replacing low-income students with wealthy international students. There are, however, two problems in his analysis.\u000aAt the beginning of the article, Ballesteros tries to establish an implausible causal link in the general correlation between the rise of international students and decrease in low-income students; however, as we are told so many times in our statistics classes, correlation does not signify causation. A more plausible hypothesis could be that the overall number of low-income students applying to CMC has decreased in the aftermath of the Great Recession. According to the College Board\u2019s college guidance outlines, many first generation students are not very knowledgeable about the college application process and/or are pressured to enter the workforce earlier. Keeping this in mind, due to the Great Recession and the slow recovery afterward, many low-income students probably entered the workforce instead of going to college, or opted for a more practical, skill-based education at a larger state school. Furthermore, research has shown that low-income students are less likely to apply to college in general (Fitzgerald and Delaney 2002; McDonough 1997; McDonough 1998), and are also less likely to enroll at more elite colleges (Bowen and Bok 1998; Hurtado et al. 1997)\u000aBallesteros also fails to give a full picture of economic diversity by limiting the scope of argument to the number of Pell grant recipients,. This is because Pell grants are fundamentally limited in their ability to measure economic diversity. Pell Grants are granted based on financial need versus cost of the school, and up to $50,000 in income. The maximum amount of funds that a student can receive through Pell grants amounts to exactly $5730. This equates to approximately 13% of CMC\u2019s $45,000 tuition. Considering that this is such a small portion of CMC\u2019s tuition, it is conceivable that falling Pell grant rates might actually mean that many low-income students are simply pursuing better scholarship options. Ballesteros\u2019 argument also presupposes that the decreasing numbers of Pell grant recipients enrolled at CMC automatically implies a decrease in \u201ceconomic diversity.\u201d However, as David Leonhardt of Upshot says, \u201cA college that enrolls many students from families making $75,000 a year may be somewhat more economically diverse than a college with an identical share of Pell recipients but fewer middle-income students.\u201d Therefore, a better, more accurate measure of economic diversity would be calculating the number of students in each income bracket.\u000aAdditionally, Ballesteros critiques CMC\u2019s decision to end partnerships with Questbridge and Posse as another example of CMC replacing low-income students with international ones. For those who do not know, Questbridge and Posse are full scholarship programs for low-income, high-achieving students and only partner with 35 and 51 colleges, respectively (which is a very small percentage of the 3500+ degree granting institutions in the US). Questbridge and Posse, while great programs, are also highly competitive. According to statistics from the Questbridge website, in 2013 there were 12,818 applicants to the Questbridge program. Of those applying, only 440 became finalists who were offered admission and college match scholarships. If considered a finalist, Questbridge will match the student to a partner school that they believe is a good fit for them. Many low-income students believe that Questbridge and other related programs are the only way to pay for college, but, in fact, if these students applied to many of the partner schools independently, they would have a better chance of attending that school. This is because many colleges, like CMC, offer 100% of demonstrated need. By ending their partnership with Questbridge and Posse, CMC (whose admissions are need-blind) allows low-income students to apply directly to the school they wish to attend and have a better chance to receive the money they need to attend college.\u000aFinally, the author proposes that one solution to alleviating the decreasing number of low-income students enrolled in CMC is an income-based affirmative action policy as a solution that, like race-based affirmative action, only treats the symptoms of a broken education system. Educational equality goes beyond equating the number of students admitted in one demographic to students admitted of another demographic. The author\u2019s entire argument falsely rests upon the assumption that the only diversity international kids bring is in the different currencies they carry. I would like to point out that, regardless of socio-economic background, international students come from an entirely different country. They bring different perspectives and experiences, which no American, regardless of socio-economic background or race could replicate. Surely, need-blind admissions policy, which CMC has, coupled with educational system reform, is a more equitable solution.\u000aShare this:Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)MoreClick to print (Opens in new window)Click to share on Pinterest (Opens in new window)Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)Click to share on Google+ (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Tags: Admissions CMC diversity Rebuttal The Student LifeCategories: Opinion Rebuttal

aS'ASCMC and the Social Responsibility Resolution: A Call to Action'
p1014
aVOn September 26th, the Associated Students of Claremont McKenna College (ASCMC) introduced a document titled \u201cThe Resolution on Social Responsibility.\u201d ASCMC has encouraged students to review the document and subsequently sign it, or at least offer constructive criticism so the document can be improved. The resolution marks another step in the yearlong journey to foster an atmosphere of inclusivity and increased personal responsibility.\u000aLast year, the Dean of Students Office and President Chodosh raised concerns over extreme student behavior during CMC social events. These concerns did not extend to the occasional, almost inevitable errors that are made under the influence of alcohol. Instead, the administration was more alarmed by the disrespectful behavior that resulted in physical harm to students as well as the destruction of school and student property.\u000aThe administration\u2019s recent effort to crack down on student behavior culminated in a series of conflicts and controversies over White Party, Rage in the Cage and routine North Quad gatherings. Many students felt that DOS supervision of parties was becoming too intrusive and counterproductive. As a result, the administration gave ASCMC the choice of taking steps on their own towards a solution, or essentially conceding to DOS changes with little to no input.\u000aIn response to this ultimatum, ASCMC held several round tables on social responsibility this past spring. These events included Athenaeum discussions, the Mirza Summit, and even the opportunity to converse with President Chodosh. Many of the opinions and viewpoints from these discussions were heavily contemplated during the drafting of the Resolution on Social Responsibility.\u000aThe resulting resolution focuses on the three main concerns of the administration regarding CMC\u2019s social culture. First and foremost, the document asks that students respect each other\u2019s bodies, identities, and property. Students are also asked to respect the campus and refrain from vandalizing school property. Finally, the resolution seeks to welcome everyone into the CMC social scene, regardless of whether or not they consume alcohol.\u000aIn order for ASCMC to present the resolution as a success to the administration, a minimum of three-fourths of the student body must sign the document. However, it is important to note that the document itself is not binding. A signature merely indicates that a student promises to uphold the ideals reflected in the resolution to the best of his or her ability.\u000aSince its drafting, the resolution has received a wide range of feedback and commentary. ASCMC held an open forum discussion during Senate on September 29th, in which all CMC students were invited to attend. After the meeting, students had the opportunity to speak one-on-one with ASCMC members regarding the resolution.\u000aIt is important to remember that the resolution is still a work in progress, and students\u2019 feedback and suggestions will be critical to the success of this initiative. Cole Mora, president of the Class of 2017, urged his class to take action, stating, \u201cWe have an opportunity here to decide what we want CMC to be going forward. Our administrators, faculty and trustees have put the ball in our court, and I\u2019m excited to show them what we\u2019re capable of.\u201d\u000aASCMC has gotten the ball rolling. Now it is in the hands of CMC students to show the administration that they are capable of addressing issues in a thoughtful, responsible manner.  The Resolution on Social Responsibility will decide much more than just the future of CMC\u2019s social climate. It will determine whether or not students have a meaningful voice in future discussions regarding important campus issues.\u000aShare this:Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)MoreClick to print (Opens in new window)Click to share on Pinterest (Opens in new window)Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)Click to share on Google+ (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Tags: ASCMC Campus Culture CMC Hiram ChodoshCategories: Campus News

aS'Out of the Jungle (Primary): Strickland vs. Knight'
p1018
aVSteve Knight (R)\u000aThirty miles north of Claremont lies California\u2019s 25th District, where two Republicans are running to replace Howard \u201cBuck\u201d McKeon in Congress. Four Republicans, two Democrats, one Libertarian, and one independent ran in the June primary, but due to California\u2019s \u201cTop Two\u201d primary system, only the top two vote-getters, Steve Knight and Tony Strickland, secured spots on the November ballot. In exclusive interviews with the Claremont Independent, both candidates shared their opinions on the effectiveness of the top-two system.\u000aTony Strickland (R)\u000aCalifornia voters adopted the top-two primary via Proposition 14 in 2010. Proponents of Prop 14 wanted to get more moderate candidates on the ballot. By allowing voters and candidates to approach elections without regard to political parties, advocates argued, candidates would be elected based on ideology and issues, rather than partisanship.\u000aWhen asked if the system had been successful in achieving its goal, both Knight and Strickland responded with a resounding \u201cno.\u201d Knight commented, \u201cI don\u2019t think you\u2019re getting more moderate candidates on the ballot. Just in this district alone, you have two conservative Republicans running in a district that is almost 50/50 when it comes to registration of Republicans and Democrats.\u201d\u000aIn California\u2019s new \u201cjungle\u201d primary system, the top two vote-getters move on to November\u000aIn CA-25, Republicans slightly outnumber Democrats, 37.61 percent to 36.51 percent. One out of every four voters is registered with a third party or with no party preference. Strickland and Knight finished the primary with 29.6 percent and 28.4 percent of the vote, respectively. Democrat Lee Rogers finished third with 22.2 percent. If Rogers won the 9.5 percent share of the vote garnered by the other Democratic candidate, Evan Thomas, Rogers would have gone on to run in the general election against Strickland or Knight. Even though the GOP vote was diluted between four candidates, enough vote-splitting occurred among Democrats and independents that it allowed two conservative Republicans to advance to the general election.\u000aStrickland also pointed out problems the system has caused for voter turnout rates and political diversity. He said, \u201cThe system was designed to force candidates to appeal to both sides of the aisle, but in reality you end up with fewer \u200bvoters. In this case, fewer Democrats will vote because their party\u2019s\u200b candidate is not on the ballot. The top two system also denies a voice to minor party candidates who could normally use general elections to expose the electorate to new ideas.\u201d After losing the primary, Democrat Lee Rogers endorsed Knight, displaying what seemed like a sign of success for the top-two system. However, he withdrew his endorsement in September and joined other Democratic leaders in abstaining from voting in the general election. In districts with same-party races, partisan politicians and voters who do not feel adequately represented have expressed that they will abstain from voting this Election Day.\u000aCalifornia\u2019s 25th Congressional District is located just north of the 27th, Claremont\u2019s district\u000aStill, Knight and Strickland must try to gain as much support as possible from Democrats and independents to win the general election. Some have argued that, in this respect, the top-two system will work by forcing candidates to appeal to more moderate voters. However, while both candidates acknowledged the importance of reaching out to Democrats and independents, neither candidate said that their outreach strategy was largely affected by running against another Republican. Knight said, \u201cOne of the many ways that Tony and I are different is that Tony does not live in the district. He ran for Congress in his home district last term and lost, and then he went shopping for a new district. He hasn\u2019t lived in this district for many, many years. I think voters would say that they want someone from their community, regardless of their party.\u201d He also highlighted that he is a former U.S. Army soldier and that Strickland has never served in the military. Strickland has reached out to Democrats and independents by meeting with members of different political parties and listening to their concerns, but said he would employ the same strategy with or without the top-two system.\u000aShare this:Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)MoreClick to print (Opens in new window)Click to share on Pinterest (Opens in new window)Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)Click to share on Google+ (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Tags: Interview Midterm Elections RepublicanCategories: Feature Interview

aS'Paul Ryan\xe2\x80\x99s Way Forward'
p1022
aVIn a 1996 interview, Robin Williams described Claremont McKenna College, where he spent his freshman year, as \u201cvery conservative, with a lot of economists, a lot of think tank guys.\u201d\u000aThe school has changed a good deal since Williams was on campus; but there is still a sizable subset of students who dream to work at the American Enterprise Institute or National Review.\u000aSuch think tank-types are engaging in a debate that is reshaping and revitalizing the conservative intellectual scene. Many of these thought leaders are coalescing around what is commonly described as \u201creform conservatism.\u201d Congressman Paul Ryan, the Chairman of the House Budget Committee and the 2012 Republican vice presidential nominee, is a think tank-type and a leading reform conservative. A frat member in college who majored in economics, he would have fit in well at CMC.\u000aRyan\u2019s central argument in his new book, The Way Forward, focuses on the importance of empowering civil society, as opposed to the government, in order to reinvigorate the \u201cAmerican Idea.\u201d\u000aHe describes the \u201cAmerican Idea\u201d as \u201ca way of life made possible by our commitment to the principles of freedom and equality\u2014and rooted in our respect for every person\u2019s natural rights.\u201d Maybe it\u2019s necessary that he coin a term that encompasses his principles; but, for a term referenced a couple dozen times in 260 pages, the \u201cAmerican Idea\u201d comes off a bit flat on paper, kind of like the word \u201cleadership\u201d at CMC. Ryan and his team could have done better.\u000aA term used to describe views not unlike Mr. Ryan\u2019s is \u201clibertarian conservatism.\u201d For those not so familiar with Ryan\u2019s philosophy, it\u2019s mainstream conservatism with Catholic influences mixed with a light version of libertarianism. It\u2019s a modern middle ground between Ronald Reagan and Milton Friedman, applying their principles to policy in new and innovative ways.\u000aWhatever his views on the \u201cAmerican Idea,\u201d Ryan is much clearer when he talks about the subjects with which he is more comfortable. Ryan champions civil society. In his language:\u000aIt\u2019s that vast middle ground between the government and the individual where our families, our neighborhoods, our businesses, our groups and associations, and our places of worship reside. It\u2019s the space where we live our lives\u2014and it\u2019s been a prominent characteristic of our culture from the very beginning.\u000aThe autobiographical aspects of his book convey the importance of these voluntary associations to the successes of cities and of individuals.\u000aOne type of association is mentorship. Ryan attributes his successes in large part to his many mentors. Perhaps his most important mentor was Jack Kemp, who Ryan worked for at Empower America. Ryan saw Kemp \u201ctour poverty-stricken areas and inner-city communities. He brought the message of conservatism to people who had never heard it before.\u201d Kemp served as Ryan\u2019s political mentor while influencing his policy ideas.\u000aSoon after leaving Empower America, Ryan was elected to Congress, where he quickly became a budget expert. After the 2010 Republican wave, he went from an outsider within the party to chairman of the Budget Committee, providing a better platform to advance his annual budget proposals. When Mitt Romney chose Ryan as his running mate, the Congressman realized that by joining the ticket, \u201cit could make [his] proposals some of the guiding documents in a Republican presidency.\u201d\u000aBut they lost. Ryan spent 2013 on a sort of listening tour in those places that don\u2019t see national Republican leaders, the kinds of places Jack Kemp visited. This year, Ryan has focused on poverty, issuing a report and a policy proposal on the issue through his budget committee in addition to his annual budget.\u000aRyan sees the government as partly responsible for making poverty more difficult and more widespread in America. His case study for dysfunction is Detroit, where government \u201ceroded the space for the community,\u201d contributing to the sorry state of the city today, where it\u2019s a victory not if a house is built but instead, razed. Detroit is a harbinger of things to come, a place where, \u201cthe encroachment of government facilitated by liberal progressive policies weakens our bonds with one another and drains our communities of their vitality.\u201d\u000aFor Ryan, \u201cthe solution to these challenges often involves government, but in a supporting role. The people\u2014in a robust and free civil society\u2014should have the lead.\u201d Ryan\u2019s poverty reform program fills a chapter in his book. It is focused on making the safety net, like the rest of the federal government, \u201csimpler, smaller, and smarter.\u201d The centerpiece of Ryan\u2019s reform is a consolidation and reorganization of many of the federal government\u2019s at least 92 programs that in 2012 spent at least $799 billion on efforts to help low-income Americans. Ryan would provide block grants to those states that chose to try his reform program. The states would then contract with nonprofits and for-profit corporations to hire caseworkers who would not just pass out checks but show their clients the path to a better life and use their discretion to provide aid based on regional and individual circumstances.\u000aRyan speaks from experience when it comes to the safety net. After his father\u2019s death, he \u201csaw government make a difference for the better in our lives\u201d through survivor benefits. They helped him go to college and in a few years his mother \u201ctransformed from a widow in grief to a small businesswoman.\u201d\u000aAs Ryan has traveled the country these last two years, he\u2019s seen civil society in action, revitalizing neighborhoods by helping addicts escape their disease and rescuing the homeless. Ryan wants government to help society heal its own wounds.\u000aFor all the promise of Ryan\u2019s poverty proposals, one risk remains: If Ryan\u2019s programs were put into place, would we run the risk that enmeshing civil society more deeply with the government could undermine it? Introducing tens if not hundreds of billions of dollars of new federal money to non-governmental organizations could lead to some serious distortions and perversions in the motivations of the organizations that make up civil society. Couldn\u2019t such a system in fact make government stronger and undermine a powerful mediator between government and the individual? Ryan calls for conditions on federal disbursements. They make sense, but conditions are already a major tool for the federal government to exert its influence in state policy and could prove excessive or counterproductive for anti-poverty grants.\u000aSpeaking of making things worse, Ryan does criticize his fellow Republicans for doing so. He directs some blame toward himself, speaking of his own error in using the language of \u201cmakers and takers\u201d to describe those who are net contributors and net recipients of federal tax money, when recipients include soldiers, retirees, and the upwardly mobile poor. He also writes that he wishes Romney\u2019s team made 2012 less a referendum and more a choice election, with lines like: \u201cYou can\u2019t simply run against your opponent; you have to stand for something.\u201d\u000aRyan\u2019s most aggressive language, however, is reserved for the Ted Cruz faction of the Republican Party, which he views as excessively opposed to compromise and, perhaps, immune to reason. Although he is known for his strong conservative credentials, Ryan provides examples of bills that came up during his legislative career that he did not like, but that he voted for nonetheless. Responsible legislators accept the best legislation possible at a given time since \u201cvotes that look \u2018pure\u2019 can really pave the way for a more harmful policy.\u201d The government shutdown was the Cruzers\u2019 lowest point:\u000aFor weeks, a few conservatives in the Senate and some outside groups had been claiming that the House could unilaterally defund Obamacare by refusing to fund the government. That\u2019s not how the law works.\u000aRyan references James Madison in response to Ted Cruz-style Republicans. Ryan applauds Madison for making serious concessions in the process of crafting the Constitution and then ardently working to see it ratified by the states. \u201cWe became the country we are because James Madison was a prudent man.\u201d\u000aNow, on to the real question: Is Paul Ryan running for president in 2016? Does he see himself as the next James Madison? He\u2019s a young man. At 44, Ryan still has about a quarter century ahead in which he could and at some point probably will seek the presidency. But is 2016 the year? Based on his book, it seems likely. It reads like a campaign book with its mix of autobiography and policy prescriptions. In a sign of restraint, there is no chart or data table in the book from the first page to the last. He will confront Ted Cruz. And look at that cover.\u000aThe policy issues raised in his book are just a few of the many conservatives must consider if they are ever to attempt an aggressive reform of the massive modern bureaucratic state. If we want a government that is more comprehensible, more manageable, and less irrational, Ryan\u2019s ideas aren\u2019t perfect, but nobody\u2019s are. His do seem likely to lead the right direction, toward a \u201csimpler, smaller, smarter\u201d federal government.\u000aThis review opens a series on the changing philosophical bent of contemporary conservatism and the ways it can be applied to policy.\u000aWatch/Read:\u000a\u2013 Mitt Romney interviewing Paul Ryan on C-SPAN\u000a\u2013 Ryan Lizza\u2019s 2012 profile of Ryan\u000a\u2013 The 2015 Ryan Budget\u000a\u2013 The Budget Committee\u2019s report on the War on Poverty\u000a\u2013 Ryan\u2019s poverty proposal, \u201cExpanding Opportunity in America\u201d\u000aShare this:Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)MoreClick to print (Opens in new window)Click to share on Pinterest (Opens in new window)Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)Click to share on Google+ (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Tags: Book Review Chris Gaarder Conservatism Paul Ryan RepublicanCategories: Book Review Feature

aVDuring my short time as a freshman here at Claremont McKenna, I\u2019ve tried my best to incorporate myself into the unique culture that exists on campus. Whether that means giving in and wearing bro tanks, which is almost comical for someone as pale as I am, or adjusting to the fact that weekday drinking is socially acceptable, there\u2019s clearly a lot of catching up to do. However, there is one aspect of the culture here that I have not and will not submit to, and that is the constant complaining about the food at Collins Dining Hall. From the beginning, the word on campus was that Collins is the worst eatery at the 5Cs, a statement that I find to be completely ridiculous. In my opinion Collins is far from the worst, a view supported both by personal experience and diligent research.\u000aSome might say that my opinion is based off of a little over a month\u2019s experience here and that after two, three, or four years, maybe my views will change. Now maybe that\u2019s true, or perhaps I haven\u2019t acquired the delicate palate that comes with living in the Claremont Bubble. Either way, I sat down with Jennifer Carbajal, the General Manager of Collins, to get the inside story. Ms. Carbajal took over as GM at the start of the 2014 spring semester and found herself the head of a well-oiled machine.\u000aDuring our meeting she touted the statistics behind what makes Collins such as successful dining hall, such as a 2014 Top 20 ranking from the Stanford Review and the facility\u2019s 25 percent local rule, which stipulates that 25 percent of all food served in Collins must be grown within 150 miles of campus. Compare this with only 15 percent required by Frary, She continued on to tell me that all of the sauces for pastas, chicken, and everything else, are made from scratch in the kitchen, and that each station must include a certain amount of protein. She and the rest of the staff are held accountable for following these rules by Bon Apetité, the parent company that serves Collins.\u000aMs. Carbajal then explained to me the environmental initiatives that Collins has adopted, many at the request of students. These include composting all food waste, utilizing sustainable \u201ceco-ware\u201d takeout containers, and shutting off the lights during off hours in order to conserve electricity.\u000aI will admit, however, that Collins is far from perfect. The administration\u2019s decision to remove the noon class slot has caused lines to be unbearable. Unbearable, of course, meaning that now instead of waiting five minutes for the pasta that is customized and sautéed just for you, you might have to wait for 10 minutes. Tragic, I know. I myself have been a victim of the controversial \u201ctoo much sauce\u201d policy and would be the first to call for a roundtable discussion on the lack of freshly baked cookies that our neighbors at Scripps enjoy with such superiority.\u000aSo in short, let\u2019s put all of these \u201cinconveniences\u201d into perspective. Instead of focusing on the fact that they expect us to make our own iced coffee out of nothing but hot coffee and ice cubes, rather than providing us with cold-brewed coffee, let\u2019s focus on the good things. Let\u2019s focus on the local ingredients, the homemade sauces, and the hardworking people that serve them every day.\u000aShare this:Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)MoreClick to print (Opens in new window)Click to share on Pinterest (Opens in new window)Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)Click to share on Google+ (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Tags: CMC Collins Dining HallsCategories: Opinion

aS'Scripps Defends George Will Disinvitation'
p1030
aVScripps College President Lori Bettison-Varga defended the college\u2019s decision to disinvite conservative columnist George Will from speaking at a conservative lectureship in a letter addressed to the Scripps Community Oct. 7.\u000a\u201cSexual assault is not a conservative or liberal issue,\u201d Bettison-Varga wrote in the letter. \u201cAnd it is too important to be trivialized in a political debate or wrapped into a celebrity controversy. For that reason, after Mr. Will authored a column questioning the validity of a specific sexual assault case that reflects similar experiences reported by Scripps students, we decided not to finalize the speaker agreement.\u201d\u000aBettison-Varga emphasized Scripps\u2019 commitment to inviting conservative speakers to campus as a part of the Elizabeth Hubert Malott Public Affairs Program, a guest lecture series established under the belief that \u201ca range of opinions about the world \u2013 especially opinions with which we may not agree, or think we do not agree \u2013 leads to a better educational experience.\u201d\u000a\u201cOver the past eight years, the Malott Public Affairs Program has diversified the educational environment for our students by featuring conservative thought leaders in a widely publicized and well-attended event series,\u201d Bettison-Varga wrote. \u201cWe do not shy away from bringing strong conservative viewpoints into our community.\u201d\u000aWill was initially slated to speak at this year\u2019s program, which has hosted conservative columnists Charles Krauthammer and Peggy Noonan in previous years, but was uninvited because of a June 6 column that he wrote about sexual assault on college campuses.\u000aThe complete Bettison-Varga letter is included below.\u000aTo the Scripps Community:\u000aThere has been a good deal of controversy in the last 24 hours over the decision of Scripps College and the Elizabeth Hubert Malott Public Affairs Program to not pay George Will to speak on campus. There are a number of important issues that are being conflated, and I wanted to take a moment to share some perspective.\u000aThe issue of sexual assault is complex, serious, and personal to Scripps students. The College has worked on a continuing basis to provide the resources and support to build students\u2019 trust and create a safe and secure campus environment. Scripps College has embraced a \u201cyes means yes\u201d policy, and we have spent the past several years working with our partner institutions to build a shared understanding of consent throughout the Claremont University Consortium community. We continue to work on ways to advance a productive dialogue on the issue of consent that we hope will further the community\u2019s awareness and support.\u000aWe invited George Will to speak as part of our Elizabeth Hubert Malott Public Affairs Program because he is a prominent conservative commentator, and we believed our community would benefit from the healthy intellectual debate that has been the hallmark of the program since 2006. Over the past eight years, the Malott Public Affairs Program has diversified the educational environment for our students by featuring conservative thought leaders in a widely publicized and well-attended event series. We do not shy away from bringing strong conservative viewpoints into our community.\u000aSexual assault is not a conservative or liberal issue. And it is too important to be trivialized in a political debate or wrapped into a celebrity controversy. For that reason, after Mr. Will authored a column questioning the validity of a specific sexual assault case that reflects similar experiences reported by Scripps students, we decided not to finalize the speaker agreement.\u000aScripps College is planning next year\u2019s Elizabeth Hubert Malott Public Affairs event, which will celebrate the ten-year anniversary of this important program at Scripps College. We will continue to welcome thoughtful, respected speakers representing diverse political perspectives to campus, and we look forward to the stimulating intellectual discourse that will occur as a result.\u000aSincerely,\u000aLori Bettison-Varga\u000aPresident\u000aImage Credit: Wikimedia Commons\u000aShare this:Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)MoreClick to print (Opens in new window)Click to share on Pinterest (Opens in new window)Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)Click to share on Google+ (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Tags: Elizabeth Hubert Malott Public Affairs Program George Will Political Diversity President Bettison-Varga Scripps CollegeCategories: Campus News

p1034
aVA prominent conservative political pundit was uninvited from speaking at Scripps College, in a program designed to promote conservative views on campus, because of his conservative views.\u000aNationally syndicated columnist George Will was slated to speak at the ninth annual Elizabeth Hubert Malott Public Affairs Program, the mission of which is to bring speakers to campus whose political views differ from the majority of students at the all-women\u2019s college, but had his invitation rescinded after he wrote a column about sexual assault on college campuses.\u000a\u201cIt was in the works and then it wasn\u2019t in the works,\u201d Will said in an interview with the Independent. \u201cThey didn\u2019t say that the column was the reason, but it was the reason.\u201d\u000aWill also told the Independent that Christopher DeMuth, former president of the American Enterprise Institute, one of the most influential conservative think tanks in the country, resigned from his position on the program\u2019s speaker selection committee over the decision to revoke the invitation.\u000aThe Elizabeth Hubert Malott Public Affairs Program was established under the belief that \u201ca range of opinions about the world \u2013 especially opinions with which we may not agree, or think we do not agree \u2013 leads to a better educational experience,\u201d according to the Scripps College website.\u000aIt has not been announced who will be selected to replace Will at this year\u2019s series. Previous speakers invited to campus by the program include conservative columnists Charles Krauthammer and Peggy Noonan.\u000aNews of the cancellation comes shortly after the release of a recurring study by Claremont McKenna College Professor Emeritus Ward Elliott that aims to measure political attitudes at the Claremont Colleges. In the most recent update of the report, Elliott could not find any Scripps faculty members who are registered Republicans.\u000a\u201cAmong the 532 [Claremont Colleges] core faculty only 15 Republicans could be found in the registries,\u201d Elliott said in an email to the Independent. \u201cPomona, Pitzer, and Scripps have a very few registered third-party core faculty, but no Republicans at all found.\u201d\u000aLibby Ramsey SC \u201817 said that the cancellation underscores the lack of political diversity at Scripps.\u000a\u201cThere is minimal political diversity at Scripps,\u201d Ramsey said in an email to the Independent. \u201cNot only this, but the minority who have different viewpoints feel uncomfortable sharing their opinions, and there is a culture of exclusion and a lack of acceptance. If Scripps claims to want \u2018to develop in its students the ability to think clearly and independently,\u2019 as our founder explained, it should not keep contributing to a culture of exclusion and silence.\u201d\u000aWill\u2019s June 6 column centered on the issue of sexual assault on college campuses, particularly regarding the federal government\u2019s recent intervention into how colleges should respond to such incidents.\u000a\u201c[Colleges and universities] are learning that when they say campus victimizations are ubiquitous (\u2018micro-aggressions,\u2019 often not discernible to the untutored eye, are everywhere), and that when they make victimhood a coveted status that confers privileges, victims proliferate,\u201d Will wrote in the column. \u201cAnd academia\u2019s progressivism has rendered it intellectually defenseless now that progressivism\u2019s achievement, the regulatory state, has decided it is academia\u2019s turn to be broken to government\u2019s saddle.\u201d\u000aProgressive groups were quick to condemn the column, and at least one newspaper, the St. Louis Post-Dispatch, responded by dropping Will\u2019s twice-weekly column from their op-ed page.\u000aFour Democratic members of the U.S. Senate signed a June 12 letter denouncing Will\u2019s column, writing that his \u201cnotion about a perceived privileged status of survivors of sexual assault on campuses runs completely counter to the experiences described to us.\u201d\u000aWill responded to the U.S. Senate in a June 13 letter, writing, \u201cI think I take sexual assault much more seriously than you. Which is why I worry about definitions of that category of that crime that might, by their breadth, tend to trivialize it. And why I think sexual assault is a felony that should be dealt with by the criminal justice system, and not be adjudicated by improvised campus processes.\u201d\u000aA representative from Scripps could not be reached for comment before press time. The Independent will update this article as their comment becomes available.\u000aUpdate: Scripps Defends George Will Disinvitation\u000aImage Source: Flickr/Gage Skidmore\u000aShare this:Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)MoreClick to print (Opens in new window)Click to share on Pinterest (Opens in new window)Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)Click to share on Google+ (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Tags: Claremont Colleges Elizabeth Hubert Malott Public Affairs Program George Will Political Diversity Scripps College Sexual AssaultCategories: Campus News

aVBefore Andrew Sullivan\u2019s talk at the Athenaeum this evening, I had a chance to sit down with Sullivan, one of the nation\u2019s most widely read bloggers, to discuss the current state of U.S. military affairs and the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, otherwise known as ISIS.\u000aAn early advocate for America\u2019s war on terror, Sullivan has previously been described as having \u201cultra-hawkish views\u201d and militantly urged the U.S. invasion of Iraq and Afghanistan in the early 2000s. He published a number of controversial articles and essays during this time, harshly targeting those on the Left for failing to back Bush\u2019s war effort. Since then, Sullivan\u2019s outlook on the war has changed, especially after the Abu Ghraib torture scandal that revealed the abuse and torture of detainees in U.S. custody. He later admitted that he was wrong about the war on terror and has regretted his brazen support for the invasions.\u000aWhen asked about the recent emergence of ISIS, Sullivan\u2019s response was highly critical. \u201cI would have a problem with ISIS if it threatened to attack America,\u201d he stated, \u201cbut it hasn\u2019t.\u201d Furthermore, he argues that ISIS is incapable of attacking the U.S. \u201cThey have no access to WMDs as far as what we know.\u201d\u000aEarlier this month, President Obama addressed the nation, outlining his strategy for countering the terrorist \u201cthreats\u201d of ISIS. His plan includes launching airstrikes against ISIS and increasing the number of American forces in the region. Obama stated, \u201cIf left unchecked, these terrorists could pose a growing threat beyond that region\u2014including to the United States.\u201d\u000a\u201cPresident Obama\u2019s statement about terrorism and ISIS is a fantasy,\u201d said Sullivan. \u201cI fear that we are now being governed by fear itself, misreading and mischaracterizing things that we should be leaving alone.\u201d Neighboring countries, such as Turkey, Saudi Arabia, and Iran, have not intervened in the conflict. \u201cIt\u2019s like welfare: they know we\u2019re just going to do it for them, and no one is grateful. No matter how successful we are, we will still be hated,\u201d he grimly noted. \u201cWe are a toxic force in the region. Everything we touch there turns to poison.\u201d\u000aImage Source: The White House\u000aShare this:Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)MoreClick to print (Opens in new window)Click to share on Pinterest (Opens in new window)Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)Click to share on Google+ (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Tags: Athenaeum Obama worldCategories: Campus News Feature

aS'Jewish Student Target of Anti-Semitic Crimes on Campus'
p1042
aVIn the span of one weekend, the same Claremont McKenna College student was the victim of two separate crimes that targeted his Jewish heritage.\u000aBryan Turkel CMC \u201915 first had his Israeli flag, which was draped across the window of his ground-floor dorm room, stolen the night of Sept. 18.\u000a\u201cThe next morning, when I came back from breakfast at 8:30 a.m., I realized that my screen door was off, but figured that someone had been drunk and ripped it off,\u201d Turkel said in an interview with the Claremont Independent. \u201cBut then, it was only later in the day that, when I went to go hang something up, and I was like, \u2018Wait, my flag is gone.\u2019\u201d\u000a\u201cThey ripped off the screen door, must have just grabbed a handful of flag, and ripped it down.\u201d\u000aTurkel reported the second incident when he noticed that his mezuzah, a scroll commonly hung on the doors of Jewish homes, was missing the afternoon of Sept. 22.\u000aWhile Turkel noted that the first crime could have been perceived as purely politically motivated, the theft of the second item, which carries no political significance and only relates to his status as a Jew, leads him to believe that both crimes were motivated by anti-Semitic attitudes.\u000a\u201cNon-Jews might hang up an Israeli flag, but non-Jews do not hang up mezuzahs,\u201d Turkel said. \u201c[Stealing] the mezuzah is not a political statement, the mezuzah is anti-Semitism, and the mezuzah is a hard-line hate crime. And the fact that the two were linked so close in time takes the doubt out of my mind that the first one was politically motivated and not anti-Semitic.\u201d\u000aTurkel also said that outright anti-Semitism is often allowed to operate under the guise of anti-Israeli political views.\u000a\u201c[These incidents] serve as a great example for how classic anti-Semitism is being cleanly repackaged as anti-Israeli sentiment and then perpetrated under that name,\u201d Turkel said. \u201cIt\u2019s still the same old hatred that caused the Holocaust; it\u2019s still out and about today. But it operates under the name of something else today.\u201d\u000a\u201cPeople are not realizing the severity and the implications of something like, in Belgium, a woman putting up a sign saying, \u2018Dogs are allowed, but no Jews,\u2019 and this is 2014, this isn\u2019t 1939,\u201d Turkel said. \u201cThe fact that this is happening and the world is basically ignorant or apathetic to it is very dangerous. Jews are feeling unsafe.\u201d\u000aAlthough he reported the first incident to Campus Safety, Turkel said that the investigation got several key facts wrong, including calling the Israeli flag a \u201cJewish\u201d flag and misreporting that he had never been the victim of anti-Semitism on campus before (he was called a \u201cKike\u201d his sophomore year), which led him to go straight to CMC\u2019s Dean of Students office to report the second crime.\u000a\u201c[Campus Safety] did not seem to give the appropriate tone and severity to responding to a hate incident,\u201d Turkel said. \u201cIn their report to Dean Spellman that I got to see, it was very obvious that they did not listen to anything I said.\u201d\u000a\u201cThe way that they handled it was so unprofessional, that I didn\u2019t go back.\u201d\u000aCMC Dean of Students Mary Spellman sent out a campus-wide email informing students of the incidents Sept. 23.\u000aShare this:Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)MoreClick to print (Opens in new window)Click to share on Pinterest (Opens in new window)Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)Click to share on Google+ (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Tags: Anti-Semitism Campus Safety Claremont McKenna College Dean Spellman Israel Israeli FlagCategories: Campus News

aS'Welcome to Our Future:  A Profile on Nathan Tsai for California State Assembly'
p1046
aVWhat if I told you that a future California Assemblymen could very well be a student in one of your classes this fall? If you haven\u2019t heard the name Nathaniel Tsai on campus or during the summer, you soon will. As of April 9, Nathan became an official write-in candidate for California\u2019s State Assembly in the 41st District. On June 3, Nathan finished yet another chapter in this journey, as he became California\u2019s youngest state nominee for State Assembly. Now Nathan has a chance to become the youngest candidate to win a state election in the entire nation later this November. Nathan\u2019s campaign has been progressively expanding throughout the summer as he prepares for the battle he will be facing later this fall. I had the opportunity to interview Nathan to get a better sense of who he is and to learn more about his campaign. Acknowledging the importance of the 5C community and its role in creating future leaders, Nathan was more than pleased to take some time to talk me about his journey.\u000aNathan was born in Glendale, CA, and was raised in Alhambra before moving to San Marino, where he graduated from San Marino High School. Nathan is currently a sophomore at Claremont McKenna, where he is majoring in Government. He is a swimmer for the CMS Swim and Dive team, an active member of the Claremont College Republicans, and a cadet in CMC\u2019s ROTC program.\u000aNathan described the significance of being a part of CMC\u2019s ROTC program: \u201cBeing raised in a family where my grandfather served in WWII, military service is something I hold close and have a deep respect for.\u201d I immediately felt the deep respect he had for those who served our country, and I was amazed to see how Nathan was so willing to carry on the torch. After completing his eight years of service, Nathan plans on looking into law school for his future career path. Commitment is something Nathan prides himself on, which he has exemplified through his continued participation in organizations like Boy Scouts of America and The American Legion. When he has free time, playing pool, hanging out with friends, and trying to play the piano are a few of his hobbies. Nathan emphasized how he wants people to get to know him for who he is, \u201cnot some politician in a suit, but rather a representative of the people.\u201d\u000aDuring our interview, it became apparent how much Nathan valued the importance of representation. As he puts it, \u201cI\u2019m not attracted to politics, but rather I\u2019m attracted to serving the interests of my constituents.\u201d Following this ideal, Nathan wanted me to know how this whole campaign did not start because of his love of politics, but rather \u201cthe opportunity to serve the true interests of his constituents.\u201d He spoke about how \u201cservice above self \u201d is an important principle he lives by, and that political office is an outlet where he could personify this principle on a grand scale. After becoming aware of the current issues Sacramento has been tackling, Nathan took the phrase \u201cbe the change you want to see in the world\u201d to heart and decided to take matters into his own hands. Only by doing so does he believe \u201cCalifornia will be able to move forward knowing the citizens actually paved the way.\u201d\u000aOne of Nathan\u2019s goals that is embedded into his platform is to bring our state politics down to a level of direct representation, where everyone can play a role in shaping their own future. Ultimately, he wants people to realize that \u201ctheir voices really do matter and to under- stand the importance of their votes.\u201d\u000aAt the end of our interview, one question still remained: Why start this campaign now? Nathan gave me two reasons. First, his involvement in ROTC would make it impossible for him to wait until after graduation to run because he would have at least another four years of service ahead of him. Second, Nathan explained how he \u201cwanted to make an impact on our generation now.\u201d Essentially, had he decided to run later, his involvement in state politics on issues like higher education would only have an effect on future generations, and not his own. Nathan plans on having a significant role in today\u2019s politics, while establishing a new mentality for other ambitious minds to adopt.\u000aAlthough his campaign is still working on major policy decisions, Nathan provided me with some key issues that he believes need attention. Education is an issue he believes is in need of serious reform, \u201cespecially when taking into account the downward path of California\u2019s public education system the past decade.\u201d Having attended public institutions himself, Nathan was able to witness first-hand the many problems with our schools, including overcrowded classrooms and a lack of appropriate funding. Another topic Nathan wants to focus on is transportation, \u201cspecifically in the public sector.\u201d Nathan realizes that future transportation projects could lead to more job opportunities for citizens of California. At the same time, he also wants to put an end to the rising concern of over-crowded freeways that everyone can attest to. Public safety is another issue Nathan is adamant about, asserting that, \u201csafety is something people shouldn\u2019t have to think twice about.\u201d Lastly, Nathan wants to tackle the apparent water and energy crises in California, with water consumption on an exponential rise and the controversial shut down of the Santa Onofre power plant.\u000aThere is still a long road that lies ahead for Nathan\u2019s campaign until this battle comes to a conclusion in November; however, it is evident that whatever the future entails for this ambitious undertaking, Nathan has already made his message clear for everyone here at the 5Cs and the rest of California: \u201cWhen trying to make a difference never let doubts or opinions get in your way.\u201d Hopefully, we can all embody Nathan\u2019s message as we work to create \u201cOur Future.\u201d\u000aTo learn more about Nathaniel Tsai and his campaign, you can visit his website at http://www.tsai4assembly.com or email him at tsai4assembly@gmail.com.\u000aShare this:Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)MoreClick to print (Opens in new window)Click to share on Pinterest (Opens in new window)Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)Click to share on Google+ (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Tags: California Politics candidate CMC Nathan Tsai Republican Zachary GrauCategories: Campus News Freshman Issue Interview

aS'The Importance of an Open Mind'
p1050
aVOn April 23, 2014, Charles Murray\u2019s talk to Azusa Pacific University\u2019s students and faculty was cancelled due to the concern that he would offend students of color. He was one of several speakers subject to student protest last spring \u2014 a list which also includes the more famous Condoleezza Rice, Christine Lagarde, and Hirsa Ali. The justification offered for each protest was that the speaker held discriminatory beliefs harmful to certain groups of people. It is important to note, though, that while speakers like Murray offended some, they would not have been invited to speak in the first place if the protesters were the consensus voice on the issue.\u000aBrewing in the background of the protests were instances in which colleges and universities were banning Christian groups from campuses all over the country. InterVarsity\u2019s Christian group at Vanderbilt University had their group recognition rescinded, and similar events occurred in April at Rollins College. Each Christian group\u2019s membership policy allowed members to hail from any walk of life, but required leaders of these groups to hold Christian beliefs in order to maintain the group\u2019s unique identity. This reasoning was found to be in violation of anti-discrimination policies at many schools, which resulted in the groups\u2019 termination. This situation poses a bit of a quagmire for schools that choose to condemn these groups because colleges are in effect trying to promote tolerance of different viewpoints and beliefs by shutting down the very groups they aim to tolerate. As you might suspect, the specific hypocrisy in banning political speakers and peaceful Christian groups from a college campus reflects a larger hypocrisy in the political correctness movement.\u000aShortly after being uninvited from Azusa Pacific University, Charles Murray spoke at the CMC Athenaeum where he was received with little incident. Immediately following his speech, however, the CMC Forum published an article in which the author heavily criticized Murray not for his speech (in which Murray carefully bracketed questions of race from his discussion), but for previously authored works in which he makes potentially racist claims. The article I\u2019m highlighting suggests an important general point: in cases where a speaker\u2019s talk is dubiously objectionable the speaker should be the subject of thoughtful reasoned discussion. After all, the way we arrive at the truth is by carefully refining our views through reasoned discussion. Judging a speaker based solely on his or her past works precludes this kind of refining discussion. It is true that there are speakers who hold uncontroversially racist or harmful beliefs, like Klansmen and Holocaust-deniers. Discourse with these kinds of people usually is not productive. But in cases where a speaker endorses a controversial view, reasoned discourse in the form of a Q and A is the best way to get to the bottom of their (potentially) flawed ideology.\u000aAs freshmen, you are entering college with a mostly blank slate. Meaning, for the most part, nobody knows what your political leanings are, or what you personally believe. You\u2019ll be tempted to identify yourself as a liberal or conservative right off the bat, but here\u2019s my advice: don\u2019t. Take advantage of your situation and try to stay away from the kind of ideological rigidity that drives people to attempt to silence voices on the other side of the issue.\u000aBecause of the massive number of different policies, which tend to be lumped under the taglines \u2018liberal\u2019 or \u2018conservative,\u2019 many people who identify strongly with one party or the other (i.e. partisans), prime themselves to think along party lines even about policies they have never heard of before. A recent study done by Emory University Psychologists demonstrated that partisans are more likely to discount any information that challenged their preexisting beliefs than nonpartisans. In other words, calling yourself a Republican or a Democrat will make you more likely to make decisions based on conservative or liberal rhetoric rather than sound reasons. Bearing in mind this psychological predisposition, keeping an open mind has a variety of benefits including:\u000a1. It\u2019ll make you smarter \u2014 Forcing yourself to think through thorny political issues with analytical rigor is great exercise for those brain muscles.\u000a2. It\u2019ll make you wiser \u2014 Since the main way we figure out whether our beliefs are true is by testing them against opposing beliefs, by discussing complex issues with others you\u2019ll get a better idea of which views are true.\u000a3. It\u2019ll make your professors and classmates respect you more \u2013 This is true partly because you\u2019ll be smarter and wiser for your efforts, but also because you\u2019ll craft a reputation for yourself as a fair-minded, thoughtful person.\u000aAs a concluding note, I want to make it clear that I realize many of the examples I catalogued in the first part of this article are instances of liberals silencing conservatives. Of course it\u2019s true that conservatives often do the same thing, with Fox News and conservative talk radio being two major culprits. The main reason that I focused on instances where liberals sought to silence conservative perspectives is that I tend to think conservatively. But engaging in discussions in which others objectively listened to my opinions and independently weighed the pros and cons of my beliefs was the crux of a fruitful and enlightening year for me at CMC. As we enter into what is bound to be an interesting election year, try to engage in thoughtful discussions with people who don\u2019t believe the same things as you, and weigh the merits of their arguments independently of your partisan predispositions.\u000aPhoto Credit: Gage Skidmore/Image Cropped\u000aShare this:Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)MoreClick to print (Opens in new window)Click to share on Pinterest (Opens in new window)Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)Click to share on Google+ (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Tags: Freshman Issue Freshman Issue 2014 OpinionCategories: Freshman Issue Opinion

aS'What are the Liberal Arts?'
p1054
aVBy now, you (incoming students) have no doubt undergone the rite of passage that consists of sitting through countless speeches on the sanctity of the liberal arts. This is perhaps especially true of the new students at Claremont McKenna College, a school that boasts of putting the \u201cliberal arts in action.\u201d Understanding exactly what kind of action these liberal arts are planning to take is of some concern; but more crucial is a question that has likely, perhaps surprisingly, remained unanswered to this point: What are the liberal arts?\u000aThe idea of the liberal arts is rooted in the writings of Plato, defined as the disciplines that one studies for the sake of knowledge itself, not in order to prepare for a specific vocation (though that may be a side-effect). In Book VII of The Republic, Plato elaborates on several areas of concentration that meet this criteria, which have over time been amended and are today generally thought to include arithmetic, the humanities (history, literature, philosophy, religious studies, and the visual and performing arts), the natural sciences, and the social sciences (economics, political science, psychology, and sociology).\u000aThankfully, you only have to choose one of them to study \u2013 maybe two if you\u2019re an overachiever (which, of course, you all are). I mean, that\u2019s why we have majors, right? Actually, Plato makes his contempt for specialization of study clear in another of his dialogues, The Apology. It was impossible for the Socratics to consider one who had only mastered a single subject to be truly learned, because true understanding comes with examining difficult questions from every point of view and mode of thought imaginable. The idea that specialization is harmful reveals the crucial concept that the liberal arts are, while distinct, all interconnected. Indeed, how can one look at complex topics, such as abortion or healthcare, without considering the scientific, philosophical, political, and economic realities that necessarily accompany them? What can past human experience, documented in literature and history and art, teach us about these difficult questions that reality alone cannot?\u000aWhile this may seem daunting, fully understanding each of these disciplines should not be the standard by which you measure the success of your liberal arts education. A few hours of concentration every week over the course of a semester is woefully inadequate for becoming completely learned in any particular subject; similarly, four years\u2019 or even a lifetime\u2019s worth of thought is insufficient for mastering the liberal arts. Even Socrates at his time of death admitted to being ignorant of much of the world, but he also regarded the humility that he acquired from fully understanding his own ignorance as one of the great advantages of the examined life. Don\u2019t be surprised if, four years from now, you leave this campus with more questions than answers; even more, be happy \u2013 it means you did something right.\u000aSo, what does this add-up to? What does thinking the most profound thoughts that have ever been thought, reading the most eloquent words that have ever been written, over a diverse array of subjects and without corrupting bias, ultimately create? Well, it creates you. The liberal arts are ultimately about, through understanding the world, understanding and creating your \u201cself.\u201d It\u2019s about having those Elizabeth Bennet moments, where you don\u2019t recognize the \u201cyou\u201d of two seconds ago.\u000aWhen I read Alexis de Tocqueville, Jane Austen, and the greatest thinkers that humanity has produced, see the way that they make seamless connections between what just prior seemed like completely different worlds, put to eloquent language what I could only describe as shapeless emotions and feelings buried somewhere deep within my soul, it makes me unable to recognize the person who occupied my body just moments ago. It\u2019s a humbling experience, but it\u2019s also an addicting one. These moments demonstrate just how completely wrong you were about a particular idea, show how woefully inadequate your own thought was to a certain problem, and reveal the deep-set flaws in your character; but they also develop within you a passion to read anything you can get your hands on and to push the limits of your thought in order to find the next major breakthrough. And developing this mentality, developing a tireless thirst for knowledge and inexhaustible dedication to thought, is what studying liberal arts is about.\u000aShare this:Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)MoreClick to print (Opens in new window)Click to share on Pinterest (Opens in new window)Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)Click to share on Google+ (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Tags: Freshman Issue Freshman Issue 2014 Liberal artsCategories: Freshman Issue

p1058
aVWe at the Claremont Independent would like to welcome the Class of 2018 to the Claremont Colleges, or, as many like to call it, the \u201cClaremont Bubble.\u201d We look forward to seeing your new faces and hearing your perspectives at the 5Cs.\u000aUnfortunately, as is the case with the majority of incoming college freshmen across the nation, we feel that you might have been told many awful things about conservatives and libertarians that simply are not true. Therefore, over the course of this year we hope to provide reasonable members of the right, left, and center an intelligent voice for the wide breadth of conservative and libertarian thought. Hopefully, through our website and social media presence you will find a forum for debate, discussion, collaboration, and intellectual growth.\u000aWe also will dedicate ourselves to hard-hitting, on-campus journalism. Thinking differently from the great majority of our peers provides us with a great opportunity to report on campus events from a different angle. With our perspective, the matter of course may seem peculiar. The boring detail, fascinating. Ultimately, the cornerstone of the CI\u2019s reputation for over two decades has been well-written investigative journalism and we intend to keep it that way.\u000aIt is important to remember that, as the only major publication that receives zero funding from the schools, student governments, and student organizations, we are uniquely insulated from the pressures faced by the other campus publications. This allows us the freedom to write about whatever subject we want and express views that established campus institutions might fundamentally disagree with.\u000aWe look forward to being a part of discussions across the Claremont Colleges and cannot wait to hear what you think about our magazine.\u000aShare this:Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)MoreClick to print (Opens in new window)Click to share on Pinterest (Opens in new window)Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)Click to share on Google+ (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Tags: Chris Gaarder Martin SartoriusCategories: Editorial Freshman Issue

aS'Introducing Libertarianism: 5 Quick Reads'
p1066
aVWhether you are waiting at the Hub in between classes or tanning on Green Beach on a Sunday afternoon, there is no better way to pass the time than a good read. If you are open to learning more about libertarian philosophies, there are five short works (all of which you can finish in one sitting) that best explain the basic tenets of libertarianism. Below is a list of scholarly articles, essays, and novellas that sparked my interest in the movement.\u000a1. \u201cI, Pencil\u201d by Leonard Read\u000aAs its title suggests, \u201cI, Pencil\u201d is uniquely written from the point of view of a pencil. This charming, 3-page narrative describes the vastly interconnected network of people, tools, and resources required for the pencil\u2019s production. Think about it: you need someone to chop the wood, mine the graphite, mix the clay, make the paint and lacquer, imprint the label, supply the metal, manufacture rubber erasers, so on and so forth. The main point the pencil seeks to illustrate is how the Invisible Hand organically brings together millions of people from various industries and all parts of the world. Each of these individuals has specialized knowledge that helps create this simple, yet important good for consumers.\u000a2. \u201cThe Use of Knowledge in Society\u201d by Friedrich Hayek\u000aFriedrich Hayek discusses the \u201cknowledge problem\u201d in this famous 14-page essay, asserting that no single person can hold all of the relevant information needed to plan an economy. The essay\u2019s premise is that bureaucratic central planners can never account for an individual\u2019s preferences, skills, and resources\u2013\u2013this knowledge is unique and exclusive to the individual. Hayek argues that this problem can be solved, however, through the price system: prices are a form of communicating subjective values between different people. \u201cThe most significant fact about this system,\u201d he writes, \u201cis the economy of knowledge with which it operates, or how little the individual participants need to know in order to be able to take the right action.\u201d\u000a3. \u201cThe Law\u201d by Frederic Bastiat\u000aWhen Ron Paul was asked what book every American should read, he answered \u201cThe Law.\u201d Frederic Bastiat, a mid-19th century French legislator, explores two fundamental questions in this 50-page pamphlet: What is the law? And how can we tell when a law is just or unjust? Bastiat provides an in-depth examination and a series of compelling hypotheses, many of which illustrate how greed \u201cplunders\u201d the law. This message is especially relevant today, as it echoes Americans\u2019 growing concerns about crony capitalism and corporatism in U.S. politics.\u000a4. Anthem by Ayn Rand\u000aIn this 128-page fictional novella, Ayn Rand takes you on the journey of a man who, in a dystopian collectivist future, rediscovers his own sense of selfhood and individualism. If you haven\u2019t read any of Rand\u2019s works before, Anthem is a great start\u2013\u2013it is much less daunting (and substantially shorter) than The Fountainhead and Atlas Shrugged. Her objectivist philosophy is renowned worldwide, and her influence is even present in modern American politics: Paul Ryan famously tried to get all of his congressional interns to read Rand\u2019s novels, and even gave copies of Atlas Shrugged to his staff for Christmas one year.\u000a5. The Revolution: A Manifesto by Ron Paul\u000aFormer U.S presidential candidate and House member Ron Paul undoubtedly has a unique set of governing ideals, as evidenced by his cult-like following. Although not a particularly compelling speaker, he effectively articulates his policy proposals in his 192-page manifesto. Paul calls for a return to the Constitution, increased self-government, and a non-interventionist foreign policy that is the antithesis of the Bush (and Obama) Doctrine. His hardline stance against both Democrats and Republicans, coupled with his libertarian streak and intriguing use of historical analysis, allows for a truly unique view of American public policy.\u000aShare this:Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)MoreClick to print (Opens in new window)Click to share on Pinterest (Opens in new window)Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)Click to share on Google+ (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Tags: Freshman Issue Freshman Issue 14 LibertarianismCategories: Feature Freshman Issue

aS'Best Places to Eat in Claremont Village'
p1070
aVWhether is it steak & salmon night at Scripps, Sunday BBQ at Frary, or taco night at Collins, the 5Cs undoubtedly have great solid dining options. Is it fine dining? Obviously not. Does it get a little monotonous as the year goes by? Certainly. However, the ability of students to eat at any of the 5C dining halls pretty much guarantees that one can find a decent meal on any given night.\u000aIn the midst of this vast array of dining options it is easy to forget that Claremont Village (or simply \u201cthe Village\u201d) offers a multitude of fantastic restaurants only a few minutes\u2019 walk away. While these dining establishments are often on the pricier side, a weekly indulgence or two doesn\u2019t hurt, and is often a fresh reminder that there is a world beyond the 5C\u2019s. Hence, here is a list of the best places to eat in the Village.\u000a \u000aBest Burger \u2013 Tie between Eureka! & The Back Abbey\u000aWhile everyone in Claremont has their own opinion in this so-called \u201cbattle of the burgers\u201d, you honestly cannot go wrong with either one. Back Abbey has a better tasting, more succulent burger, while Eureka! offers considerably more burger variety (still at a very high quality). In terms of sides, Eureka! undoubtedly has the edge, as it offers delicious sweet potato fries and onion rings in addition to standard fries. Moreover, Eureka! has a spacious atmosphere coupled with a lively, positive vibe, while Back Abbey is more cramped and low-key.\u000aUltimately, it is very hard to choose between the two, and your decision will generally come down to what you are in the mood for. Whatever you do, don\u2019t be that kid who settles for a burger from the Hub, unless you somehow enjoy chewing on dry pieces of rubber.\u000a \u000aBest Italian \u2013 Tutti Mangia\u000aIn addition to offering the best Italian food in Claremont, Tutti Mangia is likely the best overall restaurant in town. While this fine dining establishment is far from cheap, one cannot deny the quality of the food, service and overall atmosphere. A wonderful place to celebrate birthdays, or perhaps to mooch off of mom and dad during parents weekend, this restaurant will not disappoint. Furthermore, while Tutti Mangia offers tasty pasta dishes as any good Italian restaurant should, it also has a variety of top tier steaks.\u000a \u000aBest Mexican Food: Casa Moreno\u000aThere will come a time in everyone\u2019s college career when they are painfully malnourished and just want to enter a food coma. Thankfully, Casa Moreno offers gargantuan burritos stuffed to the brim with rice, beans, cheese and your choice of meat. In addition, this restaurant serves a multitude of other tasty, lighter dishes for those who prefer getting a good night\u2019s rest.\u000a \u000aBest Dessert \u2013 I Like Pie\u000aAlthough Tutti Mangia offers a top-notch dessert menu (the apple tart & cheesecake in particular), I Like Pie still wins this category by a long shot. The shop features a stellar array of seasonal miniature pies, all of which can be heated and/or topped with a generous dollop of ice cream. On a nostalgic note, I Like Pie also possesses a welcoming, charming quality as a result of its quaint embodiment of Americana. Although this will be a pricier dessert option, it is still a nice alternative to getting fro-yo at 21 Choices or Yogurtland.\u000a \u000aBest Lunch Place: Crepes de Paris\u000aThis restaurant offers an array of jumbo crepes, ranging from strawberry to decadent Nutella, all of which come with Chantilly cream and the option of vanilla ice cream. However, what makes Crepes de Paris the best place to grab lunch in the Village is the delicious sandwiches. The roasted ham & turkey sandwiches are served warm on a flaky croissant, and are nicely complimented by the fresh salads. Although the restaurant makes an amusing attempt to create an authentic French atmosphere, it has a laid-back vibe and relatively friendly service.\u000a \u000aBest Hot Wings: Espiau\u2019s\u000aUnless you aced your Spanish placement exam, pronouncing this restaurant\u2019s name will not come easy. Espiau\u2019s serves an odd combination of burgers and \u201cTex-Mex\u201d food. If you\u2019re smart you won\u2019t order the burgers or Mexican food, as both are mediocre at best. And if you\u2019re really smart you won\u2019t go anywhere near the restrooms (you\u2019ll see why). Despite this restaurant\u2019s numerous shortcomings, the buffalo wings are, for some reason, delicious. This is definitely a great place to watch a football game, as the restaurant has a multitude of TV\u2019s that show various sporting events.\u000a \u000aDisagree with Harry?

aS'Individuality Over Identity'
p1074
aVAs a thought experiment, allow me to introduce two hypothetical individuals: the first, a straight, white, church-going cis man from an upper-class background, and the second, a queer secularist of color from a middle-class family. Before you have even had a chance to converse with either of them, you have likely made an educated guess about not only who votes Republican (or Democrat), but also what each person\u2019s stance is on issues ranging from abortion to foreign policy. Rather than rail against this sort of \u201cignorant\u201d stereotyping, I will instead admit that I would likely make many of the same assumptions.\u000aI say this, however, as somebody with a relatively unorthodox identity-politics configuration. I have received more than a couple puzzled looks from friends when telling them that I am a small \u201cl\u201d libertarian who has supported more than a couple Republican political campaigns in recent years. Reactions have ranged from pleasant surprise to suspicious incredulity. A few of my peers have wondered out loud how I could possibly support members of a party whose base is anti-marriage equality and hostile to the children of illegal immigrants. To them, my identity and my politics were not only incompatible, they were downright contradictory. As an openly gay Chinese-American with immigrant parents and no religious affiliation, I simply could not be as \u201cright wing\u201d as I apparently was.\u000aI usually respond by explaining that I routinely clash with my peers on the right over my stances on issues like drug policy, evolution, and sex-worker rights. I then go on to stress the vital role of critics and reformers from within the political right, citing the growing diversity and inclusivity of the Republican Party. Recently, I have even been able to hold up two Republican candidates from my home state of California as examples. One, Neel Kashkari, is a pro-choice, pro-LGBT, Hindu who has won the gubernatorial Republican nomination, and the other, Carl DeMaio, is poised to be the first openly gay Republican elected to Congress. However, at the core of all these justifications for my political heresies is the idea that people ought to be judged not as communities or groups, but as individuals.\u000aIn the U.S., individualism is an exalted ideal. Few things are considered to be as sacred as a person\u2019s dominion over his or her choices, beliefs, and identity. Why is it then that so many people are suspicious of individuals whose politics differ from those of the majority within their racial, religious, or even sexual community? Why is it that so many people react more strongly still when the political deviant in question is a member of their own community? Unfortunately, we are driven by our tribal instincts to take refuge in our various communities and identities, only to find that those very communities tend to smother the more unique aspects of ourselves by demanding purity and loyalty. A gay Christian is living in sin and therefore no \u201ctrue\u201d follower of God, while a woman who eschews the feminist label suffers from \u201cinternalized misogyny.\u201d A pro-Israel Muslim is a Zionist sympathizer and a pro-Palestine Jew is a self-loathing anti-Semite. The accusations against those who dare to be unapologetic individuals, especially with respect to politics, are biting and numerous. It is often easier to linger comfortably in the pigeonholes and echo chambers conveniently carved out for us by our various identity-centric factions.\u000aStill, if I could impart just one piece of advice to anyone as they begin their education at the Claremont Colleges, it would be to sever for themselves the insidious ties between identity and politics that our society has forged. Learning about the world and drawing your own independent conclusions is one of the most satisfying things one can do, even if it sometimes feels like a lonely endeavor. Never take false comfort in agreeing with the majority opinions held by your racial, religious, sexual, or political groups. Never hesitate to be a pro-life feminist, pro-choice Catholic, Atheist Republican, Mormon Democrat, pro-nuclear environmentalist, or any other person that the consensus of your mind and conscience leads you to be. In a world where our race, sex, gender, sexuality, and so many other aspects of our identity are predetermined, we can all at least choose to be heretics, deviants, and above all else, individuals.\u000aShare this:Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)MoreClick to print (Opens in new window)Click to share on Pinterest (Opens in new window)Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)Click to share on Google+ (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Tags: Freshman Issue Freshman Issue 2014Categories: Freshman Issue Opinion

aS'The Not-So-Great Equalizer: Higher Education\xe2\x80\x99s Role in Fighting Income Inequality'
p1078
aVIncome inequality, defined by Barack Obama as \u201cthe greatest challenge of our time,\u201d has been a growing problem in the United States for decades. One of the many solutions proposed by Obama to solve this problem is to increase the propagation of a college education. Obama recently hosted education leaders from across the nation, including Claremont McKenna College\u2019s President Hiram Chodosh, for a White House Summit to discuss efforts made by high schools and colleges across the nation to increase college participation rates.\u000aWhile there are many proponents of education reform who argue that propagating a college education is the way to reduce income disparity, I argue that, looking at the current demographic realities of the US, this is a noble but, ultimately, futile effort.\u000aIn his recent book, Coming Apart: The State of White America, Dr. Charles Murray argues that simply increasing the number of people who obtain a Bachelor\u2019s Degree cannot solve income inequality. Murray contends that \u201cthe simple possession of a bachelor\u2019s degree does not come close to capturing the complicated relationship between education and the nature of the new upper class,\u201d as there are many hereditary factors which lead to income and cultural differences, which, in turn, create this income inequality.\u000aElite colleges have become a kind of sorting machine that allow for the intermingling of, mostly, rich, smart people. This is not because colleges have not done their job in allowing for the admission of a diverse student body, it is because rich people just tend to have better scores and higher application rates. This creates a situation where colleges become filled with rich, smart people, most of whom are going to find their future spouse there. Economists call this phenomenon assortative mating, the tendency of people with similar characteristics to marry and start families. Rich Morin of the Pew Research Center states, \u201cBetter-educated people are increasingly more likely to marry other better-educated people while those with less formal schooling are more likely to choose a less well-educated partner.\u201d\u000aAccording to Murray, the urge to be around people who are like-minded is a basic human impulse that starts at a very early age. So when people in college marry, this only keeps the people in this class separated, thereby perpetuating this income gap between the college-educated and their non-college-educated peers. This means that in order to truly get rid of income inequality, one would somehow have to quell this human instinct to mate with people that are just as smart, rich, or happy as us.\u000aA Pew Research Center study further details the growth of the income disparity as a result of a college education. According to this study, in 1960, a couple composed of spouses who had a high school education would earn about 103 percent of the average household income. In 2005, the same couple would only earn 83 percent. Similarly, couples that both completed post-graduate studies in 1960 earned approximately 176 percent of the average household income, while, in 2005, that same couple would earn 219 percent.\u000aAnother way to interpret this would be that the income disparity has only increased between the educated and non-educated despite the increase in college-educated people. Ronald Brownstein of the National Journal states that \u201cdespite Washington\u2019s huge investment in access, since 1970 the gap in college completion rates between students from the bottom and top fifths of the income ladder has doubled. Those from the top fifth are now seven times more likely to graduate than those from the bottom.\u201d\u000aMurray states that tests like the SAT were supposed to level the playing field for everyone, from the rural fields of Iowa to the elite private schools of the northeast. However, his studies show that children with at least one college educated parent tend to score higher on any test than students with none. And because college education is linked to higher income, this generally results in upper middle class students applying to more elite schools.\u000aCritics of this theory of cognitive segregation argue that it is luck or good fortune that the well-off were born into their circumstances, and this does not inherently make them smarter. However, like Murray says, the adage, \u201cShirtsleeves to shirtsleeves in three generations\u201d came about due to observed reality. Murray argues that, if a child does not inherit the intelligence of their parents, the fortune won in one generation will not necessarily survive forward generations.\u000aKeeping in mind Murray\u2019s analysis, I would argue for a different strategy to combat income inequality. I contend that we must foster an education system that truly caters to children\u2019s\u2019 different learning abilities, thereby enabling them with tools for success in whichever type of employment best utilizes their strengths. One example of such a program would be apprenticeships. Apprenticeships would allow more scholarly children to continue in their education, while allowing for children more talented in other areas to go to trade schools and take part in on-the-job training. This would allow children to cultivate their strengths, irrespective of where those strengths may lie, which would, consequently, increase all children\u2019s chances of success.\u000aIn trying to increase access to college to reduce income inequality, supporters of education reform have, in fact, missed the crux of the issue. The true problem lies not in increasing college access, but in addressing the stringent education standards that have only alienated children who have no hope of succeeding in the current academic climate. If there is any hope of reducing income inequality, it has to come from a reform of the education that will enable children to succeed in their own right. This can then create multiple pools of success as opposed to the one metric we have today: college.\u000aShare this:Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)MoreClick to print (Opens in new window)Click to share on Pinterest (Opens in new window)Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)Click to share on Google+ (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Tags: Assortative Mating Charles Murray College Coming Apart Higher Education Income InequalityCategories: Opinion

aS'What\xe2\x80\x99s up, Pam Gann?'
p1082
aVFormer Claremont McKenna College President Pamela Gann gave way to a new era at the college and the Chodosh administration on July 1, 2013, stepping down from her post after 14 years on the job. Rumors as to what Gann has done post-presidency have swirled around the campus ever since then, ranging from climbing Mt. Everest and base-jumping the Shanghai Tower, to quelling and starting Third-World uprisings. The Independent contacted Gann about taking part in an interview April 5, and all of her responses were sent via email. We hope to set the record straight on CMC\u2019s own \u201cMost Interesting Woman In the World.\u201d\u000aCI: It has been almost a year now since you left for your sabbatical. CMC students have been curious as to what you have been doing and where you have traveled to during this time. Would you mind sharing your experience with us?\u000aPG: I really love high altitude trekking, and I experienced two trips to the Himalaya. In August, I spent three weeks in Ladakh, which is in Northern India. We first acclimatized in Leh and the Indus River Valley and learned a great deal about Buddhist culture. Our trek of two weeks included over a week of camping above 16,000 feet and crossing a pass at 19,200 feet before arriving at Tso Moriri, a large sacred lake at 15,000.\u000aIn October, I left for a month in Nepal.  I spent a full three weeks in the Mt. Everest area, including trekking through three valleys, hiking to the Ama Dablam and Everest basecamps, and crossing the Cho La pass (17,870 feet) in deep snow. This trip was the finest trekking experience in my life, and I would very much like to go again to this part of the Himalaya. Many years ago, I also trekked in northern Pakistan in the area leading to K2 and up the Hispar Glacier, another amazing experience.\u000aCI: During your 14 years as CMC\u2019s President, you instituted a number of different changes. Many of these changes were major endeavors, such as raising over $635 million in a five-year fundraising campaign, establishing the Roberts Day Scholars Program, and creating a Master Plan for the college. What motivated you to institute these changes? Did you fulfill all of the goals you had for CMC by the time you left office? \u000aPG: A leader works with various constituents, particularly with the Board of Trustees, faculty, students, parents, administration and staff, and alumni, to determine how best to advance the excellence and effectiveness of the institution. We determined that CMC needed to work on all fronts, including support for faculty growth, student financial aid, and co-curricular and extra-curricular activities, a master plan and improvement of the campus functionally and aesthetically, and our outreach to alumni, parents, and friends. The Campaign enabled us to address successfully these variously identified areas of the College. Importantly, our constituents supported the Campaign, for without their enthusiastic and significant support, none of this would have happened. A leader\u2019s motivation comes from many sources, but I was always motivated by wanting to help others in our community be successful and fulfill their own personal and professional goals in life.\u000aOne area about which I was disappointed was the inability to make further progress on a second building for the Keck Department of Science. CMC, Pitzer, and Scripps were able to provide additional temporary spaces, continue to hire new faculty, and make many other improvements under the leadership of Dean David Hansen and the Keck Science faculty; nevertheless, the growth in science enrollments clearly justifies another science building.\u000aCI: Looking back, do you wish you had done anything differently during your time as President? \u000aPG: A leader is provided an opportunity to lead at a given point in the history and evolution of an organization. One\u2019s goals are to take advantage, the best that one can, of the opportunities present at that time. I think that it will be easier to answer your specific question in about five years with the benefit of hindsight!\u000aCI: Upon examining the legacy you left behind at CMC, many faculty members and students recognized that CMC\u2019s next President had very big shoes to fill.  Since his inauguration at the beginning of this year, President Hiram Chodosh has already introduced multiple new initiatives to CMC, including The Student Imperative and The Mirza Summit on Personal and Social Responsibility. What is your initial impression of the Chodosh administration? Do you have any advice for him going forward?\u000aPG: Fortunately, the CMC Board of Trustees selected President Chodosh in December 2012.  Consequently, we had six months to work together on his transition at July 1, 2013. Whatever advice that I wanted to give was communicated during that time period!\u000aThe two new initiatives that you mention are very important. Access and affordability to attend college are critical issues being addressed by The Student Imperative. When I was the Dean of the Duke Law School, I would always tell students that they were almost surely experiencing the most \u201cideal\u201d community that they would ever encounter.  It is the role of institutions of higher education to model the most \u201cideal\u201d communities that they can create, and I\u2019m sure that The Mirza Summit on Personal and Social Responsibility is rightly pursuing this honorable goal for CMC.\u000aCI: I understand that you will be returning to CMC this fall as the Trustee Professor of Legal Studies. What made you want to be a professor again after all this time? What aspect of teaching did you miss most?\u000aPG: I went into the academy as a young professor, and I always enjoyed the core activities of teaching and research. I could not be happier to be returning to these activities. I very much look forward to teaching the students at CMC and the other Claremont Colleges and the relationships that one builds with students through the classroom.\u000aCI: What courses will you be teaching this fall? Is there an area of legal studies that you would like to specialize in?\u000aPG: I am thrilled to be teaching again next year. In the fall I will be teaching a course entitled \u201cWhat Do Universities Do?: Public Policy and Leadership in Higher Education.\u201d This new course is an outgrowth of my entire professional life in higher education. We will look at many of the most important issues in contemporary higher education: the shifting historical and contemporary concerns; the discrepant purposes, values and responsibilities of colleges and universities and their intentional and unintentional social implications; the economics of the sector including finance and productivity; issues concerning the students\u2019 academic experiences and engagement and the outcomes of higher education; issues pertaining to admission and financial aid, including shifting demographics and access; issues pertaining to accountability and risk; and pathways to globalization. Throughout the course, we will be addressing leadership issues pertaining to the topic and how one would go about leading a college campus through these issues.\u000aIn the fall, I will also be teaching a version of this course at the School of Education, Claremont Graduate University, to students enrolled in master and Ph.D. degree programs.\u000aIn the spring semester, I will introduce two new courses.   \u000aThe first is also an outgrowth of my professional work, and it is entitled \u201cPhilanthropy, Voluntarism, and Nonprofits:  Law, Public Policy and Leadership.\u201d I always tell students that they are likely to work or volunteer for, lead, or govern a nonprofit organization. Why? The nonprofit area is so very broad and important in American society and increasingly outside the United States. It includes foundations, such as the Gates Foundation and the Ford Foundation, think-tanks such as The Brookings Institution and the American Enterprise Institute, museums such as the Metropolitan Art Museum and the Getty Museum, public benefit organizations like The Salvation Army and the United Way, religious organizations, civil rights organizations, and on-line organizations such as www.givedirectly.org or www.globalgiving.org. I am very pleased to introduce this new course at The Claremont Colleges. It will broadly address many key topics including: leadership, governance, accountability, who gives and why, and the appropriate public policy and legal framework for determining ideal allocations of social problem-solving among government, for-profit, and the nonprofit sectors.\u000aThe second new course is \u201cInternational Law.\u201d Citizens of the United States and other nations are impacted by transactions and activities outside of and across their national borders. They are increasingly affected by the norms and activities of international and regional organizations (e.g., the UN, WTO, NAFTA, and EU), and by the obligations of international agreements. Many international activities take place frequently in structured ways (such as cross-border trade in goods), but they may also take place in a more complex context such as economic sanctions against Iran.   Collective force may be used in Libya causing regime change, while collective force may not occur with respect to Darfur, Rwanda, and Syria. These international organizations, international agreements, international norms, and international action and inaction may impact U.S. foreign policy and the range of realistic and legal options available to address U.S. strategic interests.  International law is a legal system that affects all of these activities.  This course is designed to introduce students to a framework for understanding international law, including what it means for anyone today \u2013 legislator, policy-maker, human rights advocate, environmentalist \u2013 who has an interest in politics and international relations.  It will provide a foundation for more specialized courses.\u000aI hope that all of these new courses will appeal to students, and I am thrilled to be teaching each of them.\u000aCI: Once you return to campus, do you plan to still be involved in administrative decisions? If so, which issues would you most like to address and get involved in?\u000aPG: I will not be involved in any governance or administrative decisions.\u000aCI: After your experience as CMC\u2019s President and your time on sabbatical, do you have any advice you would like to offer to CMC students?\u000aPG: I do not think that there has ever been a time more exciting and important to be a student. You are fortunate to be at CMC. I would simply urge you to take advantage of everything that CMC has to offer, to be bold and intellectually adventuresome, and to be engaged with your faculty.   Finally, always leave CMC a better place than when you first entered the College; and you should think about how best you individually or in groups can accomplish this.\u000aShare this:Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)MoreClick to print (Opens in new window)Click to share on Pinterest (Opens in new window)Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)Click to share on Google+ (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Tags: Claremont McKenna CMC Hiram Chodosh Pam Gann Pamela GannCategories: Campus News

aS'Bigotry at the Ath: A Response to the CMC Forum'
p1086
aVIn the opening line of her recent Forum piece \u201cWhy is CMC Promoting Racism and Sexism?\u201d CMC Freshman Liat Kaplan wrote, \u201cI\u2019m not going to summarize political scientist Charles Murray\u2019s recent Ath talk here because if I do, the stress will probably give me a heart attack.\u201d Bracketing a discussion of Kaplan\u2019s coronary arteries, it\u2019s clear that Kaplan should have consulted her notes on the talk \u2013 if she took any. Kaplan\u2019s portrayal of Charles Murray\u2019s Athenaeum talk is as false as her ill-thought-out cries of bigotry.\u000aKaplan asserts that during his speech Murray claimed \u201cthat poor people, especially people of color, are genetically predisposed to be less intelligent,\u201d \u2013 a thesis which appears in Murray\u2019s 1994 text The Bell Curve. This assertion is factually inaccurate, and wildly so. The subject of Murray\u2019s Ath talk was his more-recent book, Coming Apart: The State of White America, 1960-2010, a study on class inequality. Murray clarified in the first five minutes of his speech that he excluded race from consideration in Coming Apart, in order to pinpoint the effect of college admissions on class inequality. The words \u201cThe Bell Curve\u201d never left Murray\u2019s mouth.\u000aAs a preface to his talk, Murray carefully noted that he was only presenting sociological evidence, not a normative stance on the issue of class inequality. It is difficult to reconcile this very overt sidestep of ethical issues with Kaplan\u2019s claim that in Murray\u2019s address \u201cwhole swaths of humanity [were] categorically deemed inferior.\u201d The only very vaguely sexist thing Murray said, over the entire course of the talk, was that wives tend to civilize husbands and make them more productive; however, he noted that this was putting \u201cnot too fine a point on it,\u201d and added the caveat that this thesis was only one explanation for the empirical truth that married men tend to be more economically productive than their unmarried counterparts.\u000aWhat claims did Murray make at the Ath? During his talk, Murray focused exclusively on his thesis in Coming Apart, which is that the new upper class and lower class which have formed in America diverge more sharply than ever before in terms of core values like family and community life. The causal story which Murray emphasized in his Ath talk was that the college admissions process tends to concentrate high-IQ persons together at elite colleges and universities, where they often marry each other, become members of the new upper class and have children who lead sheltered lives in their upper class social bubble. Members of the new upper class, on Murray\u2019s account, are typically insulated from an authentic understanding of the lives of their lower-class counterparts, which poses a grave problem for democracy since, in most cases, America\u2019s governing elite wind up being members of the new upper class \u2013 individuals with little understanding of the lives of their constituents.\u000aA crucial point here is that Murray\u2019s thesis in Coming Apart is compatible with a wide range of normative stances. Murray seemed to indicate that he didn\u2019t favor a class of elites who had never lived outside the bubble, but rather thought that a healthy democracy required its leaders to understand the lives of all their constituents. This remarkably progressive vision strongly contradicts the elitism Kaplan attempts to read into Murray\u2019s argument. And although The Bell Curve did not feature in Murray\u2019s talk, a similar principle applies. Even if one accepts the empirical truth that average IQ varies along ethnic lines, one can still, of course, recognize that the evolutionary and historical forces which contributed to racial IQ disparities were arbitrary and oppressive, respectively \u2013 and ought to be corrected for through affirmative action or educational reform, for instance. The bottom line is that Murray\u2019s Ath talk involved statistical data, not the highly offensive ethical claims Kaplan thought she heard. The reason students didn\u2019t angrily condemn Murray as a racist or a sexist during the Q & A is that he didn\u2019t defend anything even remotely close to a \u201cracist\u201d or \u201csexist\u201d position.\u000aMy last Claremont Independent article argued that the censorship of oppressive viewpoints is virtually never justified, and, coincidentally, considered Murray\u2019s The Bell Curve. So instead of critiquing Kaplan\u2019s views on censorship here, I\u2019d like to conclude this article with a discussion of the problem of bigotry.\u000aIn her article, Kaplan repeatedly characterized Murray as a bigot. A bigot is defined as \u201ca person who strongly and unfairly dislikes other people, ideas, etc.\u201d While Murray\u2019s views may not align with Kaplan\u2019s own, they emphatically do not make him a bigot.\u000aEach of Murray\u2019s views is the result of fair and thoughtful consideration \u2013 for instance, Murray recently changed his mind, on reflection and decided to support the legalization of abortion and same-sex marriage. Charles Murray is remarkably open-minded for a man Kaplan essentializes as a racist, sexist, \u201cold white rich man who thinks that women and people of color are inferior beings.\u201d Indeed, Murray is far more open-minded than Kaplan herself. While Murray grounds his viewpoints in statistical evidence and careful reflection, Kaplan writes angry tirades only marginally evidenced by a single peremptory Google search. While Murray favors the open exchange of conflicting viewpoints (and explicitly thanked Claremont McKenna for hosting exactly that kind of exchange at the Athenaeum), Kaplan favors a McCarthy-esque policy of censoring individuals with whom she harbors moral disagreement. Consequently, the true bigot in this episode is Kaplan. If Kaplan genuinely felt Murray\u2019s talk dehumanized and devalued her as a human person, she has some serious soul searching to do.\u000aShare this:Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)MoreClick to print (Opens in new window)Click to share on Pinterest (Opens in new window)Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)Click to share on Google+ (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Tags: Charles Murray CMC Forum Coming Apart The Athenaeum The Bell CurveCategories: Opinion Rebuttal

aS'Lone Star Farce: A Response to the Claremont Port Side'
p1090
aVIn what will be the most high-profile gubernatorial race of the year, Texas Attorney General Greg Abbott looks to succeed the 14-year incumbent Rick Perry, who has led the Lone Star State to the pinnacle of economic prosperity. Abbott\u2019s Democratic opponent will be State Sen. Wendy Davis, who ascended to national fame in 2013 by filibustering a strict Texas abortion bill that ultimately became law. Unless Abbott catastrophically implodes, the governor\u2019s mansion is unequivocally projected to remain in Republican hands. Regardless, liberals nationwide have seized this opportunity to advance their agenda of exposing misogynistic elitism and the oppression of women.\u000aThe Claremont Port Side appears to have drunk the Kool-Aid. In an article titled \u201cLone Star Democrat \u2013 Why Texas Can\u2019t Handle Wendy Davis,\u201d published in the magazine\u2019s recent \u201cFeminism Issue,\u201d the two authors embark on a variety of uncoordinated tangents and proffer a series of unsubstantiated claims regarding the gubernatorial race. As a consequence, the article\u2019s account of the gubernatorial race is misleading, and skews political realities to accommodate their narrative of Republicans unfairly persecuting Davis.\u000aThroughout the article, the authors advance the idea that \u201crepublicans are desperate to slander Davis\u2019 character\u201d because \u201can ambitious woman threatens men.\u201d However, this assessment rests on a painfully superficial understanding of Texas politics. Kay Bailey Hutchinson (R-TX), the first female Senator to represent the Lone Star State, recently retired after a very successful 20-year congressional tenure. Her enormous popularity was exhibited by the fact that she nearly defeated Rick Perry in a 2010 GOP primary challenge for governor.\u000aOther women who have made significant inroads into the Texas political scene include two current justices of the Texas Supreme Court, Eva Guzman (R-TX) and Debra Lehrmann (R-TX), both of whom have been elected with wide margins. Moreover, Nandita Berry (R-TX), recently became the first Indian-American and one of only a handful of women to serve as the Texas Secretary of State.\u000aIn an obvious way, these women are all living, breathing examples of how \u201cwomen can stand up for themselves in Texas.\u201d They are indicative of the fact that oppression of women in Texas politics is neither systematic nor commonplace. As a result, the Port Side\u2019s underlying theme that Davis will suffer in the general election due to an anti-female political environment holds little to no merit. She\u2019ll suffer in the general all right, but she\u2019ll lose on policy \u2013 not as a victim of insidious structural oppression against women.\u000aNevertheless, the authors seek to crystallize on this point, claiming that \u201cby virtue of her being a woman, Davis endures far more scrutiny than male politicians.\u201d Yet the only concrete example provided of unfair criticism directed at Davis is an isolated incident in South Carolina (note: South Carolina), where former state Republican Party Director Todd Kincannon made a series of offensive and ill-advised comments.\u000aI wholeheartedly agree that Mr. Kincannon\u2019s slanderous Twitter campaign was despicable \u2013 but one cherry-picked extreme case from another state does not prove a rule. Here\u2019s an alternative narrative that coheres with all the facts: conservatives are critiquing Davis because she\u2019s a liberal progressive, and investigating the accuracy of her personal story because (and let\u2019s be absolutely clear on this point!) she\u2019s playing the game of politics.\u000aGreg Abbott, a paraplegic, has been subject to equally venomous slander from the Davis camp.\u000aBattleground Texas, a liberal group composed of veteran Obama campaign officials, seeks to help elect an increasing number of Democrats in the Lone Star State, Davis included. A recent undercover video exposed members of the organization mocking Abbott for his disability and confinement to a wheelchair. The legitimacy of the video is validated by the fact that it merited a response from Davis herself, who quickly condemned the video\u2019s cruel language.\u000aWendy Davis has undoubtedly received brash, unwarranted criticism that lacks any possible justification; however, liberals such as those at the Port Side appear to suffer from severe tunnel vision, believing that they are the only victims of political foul play. This is a dubious proposition considering the aforementioned criticism direct at Abbott, which was sadistic and beyond the realm of reason. Remember: this is politics we\u2019re talking about.\u000aThe authors conclude their disparate series of observations by offering the prediction that the \u201cconservative backlash against Davis\u201d will be \u201cpervasive enough to significantly impact the gubernatorial election.\u201d Once again, this assertion simply is not grounded within the realm of reality, and is nothing more than wishful thinking.\u000aFor months, Abbott has held a comfortable double digit lead over Davis, one that is not expected to dissipate anytime soon. Perhaps the most damning reality for liberals is the fact that no Democrat has been elected to a statewide office in Texas since 1994. In today\u2019s deeply polarized political environment, the chances of Davis upsetting the status quo are minimal at best.\u000aWhile those at the Claremont Port Side may believe that Davis will be able to remain a \u201cviable political candidate in Texas,\u201d we at the Claremont Independent hold a more rational perspective.\u000aBarring a move to another state, Davis will likely disappear into political abyss following a decisive defeat this fall. This is due to the fact that the current political environment in Texas, coupled with the limited lifespan of political candidacies, will effectively mitigate Davis\u2019s chances of ascending from her state senate seat to any statewide office.\u000aBrandishing the victim card and angrily appealing to the oppression of women, while classic feminist strategies, are ultimately ineffective at securing concrete political outcomes \u2013 at least in Texas. In addition to energizing the Republican base, polarizing feminist rhetoric will alienate many independent voters, which are critical in a general election. So don\u2019t be surprised when Abbott sends Davis into political oblivion this November.\u000aShare this:Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)MoreClick to print (Opens in new window)Click to share on Pinterest (Opens in new window)Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)Click to share on Google+ (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Tags: Abortion Claremont Port Side Port Side Texas Wendy DavisCategories: Opinion Rebuttal

aS'The Six Californias Delusion'
p1094
aVWelcome to West California, everyone. Well\u2026 if Tim Draper get his way. Draper\u2019s idea to break up California into six different states has been trending across Facebook recently with students of the Claremont Colleges, and, surprisingly, most of the responses have been generally supportive of the idea.\u000aDraper argues that California\u2019s government is too out of touch with the people, and that, therefore, California should split up into six states to bring government down to a more local level; however, by splitting up California, Draper would create many more problems than he would ever solve.\u000aDraper\u2019s proposal seems vastly out of touch with the current socioeconomic realities of California and very much skewed in the favor of wealthy Californians. This is evident simply in how Draper splits up the state of California. Under his proposal, almost every wealthy area in California would be bundled up into either Silicon Valley (San Francisco, Palo Alto) or Western California (LA, Anaheim). Therefore, under Draper\u2019s proposal, California would immediately see the gap between the wealthy and poor widen to an unimaginable extent. In interviews, Draper claims that, while he is a rich man (which is an understatement for someone with a net worth of over a billion dollars), he just wants to see his children get a better education from his tax dollars. This quote reeks of self-interest, as Silicon Valley, being the wealthiest of the six new states, would clearly be able to provide Draper\u2019s children with a better public education than it currently does since his tax dollars wouldn\u2019t be spent on providing education for children in poor areas of the old state of California.\u000aThe outlook in the poorer of Draper\u2019s proposed states, on the other hand, would not be as rosy. Draper\u2019s proposed state of Central California, which would include cities like Fresno and Stockton, would immediately become the poorest state in the USA, with a per capita GDP $150 lower than Mississippi. One can imagine that, if California splits up, states like Central California would not be able to provide any of the services it currently provides to any sort of acceptable extent. Conveniently, Draper does not propose a way to keep Central California functioning at the levels it currently does while being supported by the tax dollars of wealthy Californians like himself.\u000aAnd it\u2019s not just vital government services that would be unable to function at present levels if California were to breakup; entire state economies would be at risk due to the breakup. It\u2019s no small secret that California\u2019s agricultural sector is dependent on the government to weather bad seasons. For example, these past few months saw the California government inject $687 million into the agricultural sector as part of a drought relief program (the Federal government, by comparison, only injected $165 million for their drought relief program). If California were to split up, one can imagine that the new state governments in established agricultural bases, such as Central California, would go bankrupt trying to keep their agricultural sectors afloat. This is problematic because California has been the largest food and agricultural producer in the U.S. for over 50 years. If the agricultural sector in new states such as Central California were allowed to go under, there would be a drastic increase in the price of food as food supply drops. Food deficits, therefore, would have a negative effect on the livelihoods of individuals and families nationwide, not just those living in what used to be California.\u000aDraper also ignores the monolithic logistical problems that his proposal creates. At the moment, California barely has enough water to keep going. It has gotten to the point where water has to be taken from certain areas in the north of California down to the south, to places like Claremont, which does not get enough water to survive on its own. Currently, the issue of water rights is extremely contentious, so one can imagine that it would be an even more difficult task to make agreements between states to give each other water.\u000aFurthermore, the way Draper drew his proposed states lines seems to show he has no idea how people work outside of Silicon Valley. Take his proposed line between Southern California and Western California, which would make the San Bernardino-Los Angeles county line (which falls between Claremont and Upland) a state line. Suddenly, the almost two million people who live in the Inland Empire but work in Los Angeles would be living in one state, Southern California, but working in Western California. This would lead all of these individuals having to file out-of-state taxes, all of which would go to the coffers of Western California. This would only serve to increase the gap between the poor and the rich states, and, essentially, segregate California\u2019s citizens across socioeconomic lines.\u000aAll in all, Draper\u2019s proposal seems like a rich man\u2019s delusional plan to not have to foot the bill for the poor of California. Instead of trying to create vastly unequal states, Draper should use his billions to try to cut some of the bureaucratic red tape that has covered California\u2019s state legislature as of late. Tax and budgeting reform, as a start, would cover many of Draper\u2019s qualms about a state government that is out of touch with the people. This could include moving budgetary control of school funds to a more local level, instead of putting all the power into the hands of bureaucrats in Sacramento who have no idea of the needs of people in remote places in California (or those in Silicon Valley, too). Hopefully, Californians (and, if it comes to it, Congress) will have the common sense to reject Draper\u2019s proposal and find a better way to reform their state as one California.\u000aRead Chris Gaarder\u2019s opposing opinion on the Six Californias Plan\u000aShare this:Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)MoreClick to print (Opens in new window)Click to share on Pinterest (Opens in new window)Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)Click to share on Google+ (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Tags: California Six Californias Tim DraperCategories: Opinion

aS'One California, Divisible'
p1098
aVIn the April 2014 issue of the Independent, my dear friend Martin Sartorius makes clear his distaste for Silicon Valley billionaire Tim Draper\u2019s plan to split the Golden State into \u201cSix Californias.\u201d It is, no doubt, a crazy idea. Come November, I\u2019ll probably vote against it. From a practical perspective alone, the thought of splitting one state into six is intimidating.\u000aThere is, however, a case to be made for dividing California as outlined in Mr. Draper\u2019s proposal. In fact, there are many different approaches to argue for dividing up the state, but I will focus on three. First, division would cool Californians\u2019 long-simmering frustration with their lack of representation in the US Senate. Second, California\u2019s \u201cblue model\u201d government, to use a term popularized by Bard College Professor Walter Russell Mead, has failed its people in ways that even three-term, center-left Governor Jerry Brown cannot fix. Third, partition would not only bring state governments closer to their people, but also promote innovation within and competition between the new state governments.\u000aRepresentation\u000aNumbering almost 40 million, Californians make up an eighth of America\u2019s population. Californians make up an eighth of the House of Representatives. But while California is more populous than the 21 smallest states combined, those states have 42 Senators while California has two.\u000aAmerica\u2019s Senators represent on average about six million people. About six million people would also be the average population of the six new Californias \u2013 Central California, Jefferson, North California, Silicon Valley, South California, and West California. Adding ten new US Senators would bring California\u2019s senatorial representation in line with the rest of the nation. While a dearth of Senate representation is a serious concern, day in and day out, the average Californian has to put up with much more troubling issues, ones Sacramento has shown it cannot solve.\u000aThe Death of the California Dream\u000aCalifornia has arguably failed its people. It is not only the state with the most poverty in absolute terms, but also the highest poverty rate relative to every other state. Nearly a quarter of Californians are impoverished. With substantially higher costs of living, it is hard to live comfortably on even a middle income in many parts of the state. Schools rank among the very worst in the country in terms of student performance and per-pupil spending. Meanwhile, the total statewide debt is staggering, lying somewhere between $848 billion and $1.1 trillion.\u000aFor such a large and economically diverse state, California should have an average unemployment rate, but the state\u2019s unemployment rate has consistently ranked among the worst nationally. Currently at 8.0% using the U-3 model, Californians face the fourth worst unemployment situation in the nation. About half of counties contend with double-digit unemployment. Those who do work face some of the highest income taxes in America. Among other organizations, Chief Executive has rated California\u2019s business climate as the worst in the nation, for nine years running.\u000aOpponents bring up the fact that if California were split, two of the new states, Silicon Valley and Central California, would immediately become America\u2019s richest and poorest states, respectively. However, when residents in Central California today are poorer on average than people in America\u2019s poorest state, Mississippi, is today\u2019s California really working for them?\u000aFor these reasons and more, almost four million Californians have moved to other states over the past 20 years. While the climate is great, Californians have to put up with more structural barriers to survival and success than the average American. And with the state\u2019s political leadership offering few creative ideas beyond funding campaigns with international arms trafficking or taking bribes to enrich their relatives (interactive), the outlook for the future is not much better. Managing the decline is taxing enough. But divvying the state up would certainly be no picnic. So why split?\u000aBenefits of Separation\u000aImagine the unique opportunity created by six Californias. While the states are often referred to as the laboratories of American democracy, separation from one unified state into six would create the ultimate opportunity to experiment in state-level policy. In Silicon Valley a debate could rage between old-school liberals and libertarian liberals, governing with a synthesis of the two; Western California could double down on the state\u2019s extant blue model policies; Central California and Jefferson could institute libertarian-conservative red model government; and North and South California would likely form purplish governments. Generations of political scientists could study how each of these states evolved. Dividing along county lines makes a treasure trove of data useful for comparative analyses.\u000aAs it stands today, vast amounts of wealth and people are flowing out of the wealthiest parts of California to other states, and from other states into the poorer parts of California. If the poorer, inland, often more conservative regions could craft their own policies, they might well become meccas for opportunity like Texas, which has posted robust, broad-based job growth since 2000 and could serve as their model. Coastal, wealthier, bluer parts of today\u2019s California could focus on reducing income inequality, expanding government services, and keeping people and capital inside their territories. Rather than leaving for Texas or Colorado, Californians could move an hour away to the California experience that is right for them.\u000aBuilding six new state governments in the digital age would bring new and unexplored opportunities to the new Founders of California. Within governments, starting afresh with heavy integration of technology resources and innovative constitutional and bureaucratic models could increase government efficiency and provide other now-unknown benefits. Between governments there could be healthy competition mixed with cooperation on issues ranging from higher education to public health to water to earthquake and fire preparedness. On competitive cooperation they could look to the Claremont Colleges for advice.\u000aAnd if the split were to happen, we could all still call ourselves Californians. We have a shared history \u2013 Hiram Johnson, the Brown Dynasty and Ronald Reagan; a shared Spanish heritage; the \u201849ers; Prop 13; and a \u201cGolden Moment\u201d when California was the envy of the nation. Our parents and grandparents were drawn to this state for its once-plentiful opportunities; and the allure of California lingers still. The climate, the lifestyle, and the quality of people in California are hard to beat. But the situation outside of a few relative oases is so difficult for the average Californian that something has to change. Crafting policies geared toward the subtly or substantially different characteristics of these six different regions is a good place to start. By breaking California into six states, we might see Californians thrive more than ever before.\u000aRead Martin Sartorius\u2019 opposing opinion on the Six Califonias Proposal\u000aShare this:Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)MoreClick to print (Opens in new window)Click to share on Pinterest (Opens in new window)Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)Click to share on Google+ (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Tags: California Six Californias Tim DraperCategories: Opinion

aS'Let\xe2\x80\x99s Talk about Academic Freedom'
p1102
aVIn a recent Harvard Crimson article, Harvard student Sandra Korn endorses the abridgment of academic freedom in order to prevent the publication of research promoting or justifying oppression. Her view is not particularly remarkable, and it certainly isn\u2019t novel, but it is worth correcting nonetheless.\u000aThe constitutional case for academic freedom is clear. In Sweezy v. New Hampshire (1957) the Supreme Court accepted Justice Frankfurter\u2019s rationale in Wieman v. Updegraff that \u201cunwarranted inhibition [of academic freedom]\u2026has an unmistakable tendency to chill that free play of the spirit which all teachers ought to cultivate and practice\u2026Teachers must\u2026be exemplars of open-mindedness and free inquiry. They must have the freedom of responsible inquiry, by thought and action, into the meaning of social and economic ideas, into the checkered history of social and economic dogma.\u201d Later, in Keyishian v. Board of Regents (1967), the Court also upheld academic freedom and freedom of association in light of the First Amendment.\u000aBoth Sweezy and Keyishian were explicit constitutional prohibitions on McCarthy-esque purges, and invoked the phrase \u201cacademic freedom\u201d in particular. Because Korn\u2019s vision of \u201cacademic justice\u201d requires censorship of professors\u2019 publications on the basis of their political views, it is analogous to McCarthy\u2019s witch-hunt of socialists. One can assume then that Korn does not find the constitutional argument for academic freedom compelling. So, in the interest of attempting to persuade Korn to revise her beliefs on the subject, I\u2019ll articulate a philosophical argument for strict First Amendment protection of academic freedom.\u000aKorn argues that \u201cacademic justice\u201d requires censoring academic publications in order to ensure they aren\u2019t oppressive. This is sort-of intuitive at a very superficial level \u2013 after all, oppression is bad, and we should prevent bad things when possible. Furthermore, Korn contends that \u201cno one ever has \u2018full freedom\u2019 in research and publication\u2026what papers are accepted for publication are always contingent on political priorities.\u201d But this semblance of a syllogism and unapologetic naturalistic fallacy does not bear out. Korn ought to take a philosophy class.\u000aKorn\u2019s chief example of an oppressive academic publication is Harvard Professor Richard Herrnstein\u2019s 1971 article \u201cI.Q.,\u201d which makes the claim (which would later be reiterated in Herrnstein\u2019s famous work The Bell Curve), that intelligence is primarily hereditary and varies by race. According to Korn, Herrnstein concludes in \u201cI.Q.\u201d that \u201csocial programs intended to establish a more egalitarian society were futile.\u201d\u000aEven granting her this caricature of Herrnstein\u2019s thesis, Korn\u2019s strategy of promoting \u201cacademic justice\u201d by ensuring that research that promotes or justifies oppression isn\u2019t published is highly problematic. Any attempt to censor politically incorrect views creates problems for Korn\u2019s argument because any method for distinguishing between \u201csufficiently oppressive\u201d and \u201ctrivially oppressive\u201d speech is ultimately arbitrary.\u000aHow will one go about delineating between views that are sufficiently oppressive to be censored, and views that, while marginally oppressive, don\u2019t cross whatever arbitrary \u201coppressiveness threshold\u201d one constructs? For instance, is this article the sort of thing that ought to be censored? I am, after all, openly endorsing the publication of exactly the kinds of oppressive academic works Korn opposes. While certain kinds of academic speech, for instance Holocaust-denial, would clearly fall on the \u201coppressive\u201d end of Korn\u2019s spectrum, few such cases are so straightforward.\u000aThe erection of a litmus test for acceptable ideology is a messy, oppressive endeavor. Remember, for instance, McCarthy-era Red-baiting. The question: \u201cWho must agree that an academic work is oppressive in order for it to be justly censored?\u201d is unanswerable, and itself suspect. A liberal commitment to inclusion of conflicting voices renders Korn\u2019s principle untenable in theory and in practice.\u000aThat being said, Korn has captured the germ of an important issue. Some academic works, like Ward Churchill\u2019s essay comparing the victims of the 9/11 terrorist attacks to \u201clittle Eichmanns,\u201d clearly perpetuate unjust views. However, I contend that, instead of censoring these publications, one must counter oppressive views through reasoned debate. Academic discourse over controversial publications is not only an effective means to combat oppressive viewpoints, but, more important, the only way to avoid well-intentioned, but morally bankrupt, censorship of the Joseph McCarthy variety.\u000aOppressive viewpoints are definitionally false viewpoints, so the task of undermining an academic\u2019s arguments for an unjustified belief should, generally, be an easy one. The primary feature of reasoned discourse is that it tends to get at the truth, including those truths that undermine the arguments in offensive academic publications. Herrnstein\u2019s work on IQ is a case in point. In an article summarizing statistical findings post-Bell Curve, UC Berkeley Professor David Kirp notes that sociological research on the IQ debate has concluded that, while inherited genetic makeup is the largest determining factor on intelligence, socioeconomic factors and access to quality education also play a significant role. Taken together, research on this nature/nurture debate supports the conclusion that social justice policies like educational reform still have a significant role to play in levelling the playing field for the least well-off.\u000aThe philosophical problem of identifying which academic publications are, according to Korn\u2019s argument, \u201cunjust,\u201d and the practical problem of assembling commissions to evaluate whether a particular publication meets whatever standards of injustice Korn might try to outline are convincing reasons to opt for an inviolable right to academic freedom. Though, clearly, some publications seem to perpetuate just views and others unjust views, most academic works inhabit an uncertain gray area. Consequently, rulings on the \u201cjustice\u201d of a particular academic work are highly susceptible not only to human error, but to the broader possibility that our current conception of \u201cacademic justice\u201d is, as Joseph McCarthy\u2019s was, just plain wrong. In light of these human failings, and understanding the history of academic censorship in this country, we would do well to be wary of the notion of censorship itself.\u000aTherefore, the appropriate response to academic works that disseminate unjust viewpoints is not the crude strategy of moral browbeating embodied in censorship, but an exposition of reasons an unjust view is unjustified. The right strategy in combating oppression is not to silence the opposition, but to engage in debate and invalidate oppressive viewpoints with factual evidence. One must remind the public not only that academics who endorse oppressive views are wrong, but also why those academics are wrong. While the risk that censorship may be abused is ever-present, engaging in moral argument to refute an offensive academic publication is, ethically speaking, risk-free.\u000aShare this:Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)MoreClick to print (Opens in new window)Click to share on Pinterest (Opens in new window)Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)Click to share on Google+ (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Tags: Academic Freedom Censorship Harvard CrimsonCategories: Opinion

aVThe Claremont Independent has come under fire recently. Not only were several copies of our most recent issue physically torn apart on the Scripps campus for brandishing the sign of the devil (the drawing on the cover was of the GOP elephant), but the magazine also found itself being torn apart within the opinion pages of The Student Life, where one columnist opined on what he found most \u201cincredulous\u201d about the Independent.\u000aIt is worth pointing out that we believe it a complete coincidence that the columnist only stopped to share his thoughts about the Independent after it published a not-so-flattering rebuttal to one of his previous columns, in which he urged the Claremont Colleges to join in the American Studies Association\u2019s boycott of Israeli academic institutions. But, ulterior motives aside, the author\u2019s criticisms of the magazine hold both little weight and scant coherence. From the top:\u000aFirst, the author notes his disappointment that \u201cthe magazine was not at all the source of libertarian or even classically conservative journalism that it claimed to be,\u201d which assumes that we claim to be anything at all. If the author had taken the time to read our mission statement, talk to any of our magazine\u2019s leadership or staff, or even read closely the name of the magazine (Claremont \u201cIndependent\u201d), this initial disappointment could have easily been avoided.\u000aSecond, the author censures the Independent as \u201c\u2026just another digest of popular Republican Party talking points,\u201d no doubt referring to our piece about Republicans\u2019 increasing odds of taking back the Senate in the upcoming midterm elections; however, this criticism does not have a leg on which to stand. Analyzing trends, polling data, and candidates to form an election forecast is hardly the same thing as espousing \u201cRepublican Party talking points.\u201d In fact, since publishing our article, The Economist, The Atlantic, and Nate Silver\u2019s \u201cBig Data\u201d website, 538, have published articles concurring in our view. We look forward to an upcoming TSL column deriding these media outlets as nothing more than purveyors of \u201cRepublican Party talking points.\u201d\u000aThird, and perhaps most bizarre, the author claims that he \u2013 by taking the stance that the Claremont Colleges should boycott Israeli universities \u2013 is the true standard-bearer of the classically conservative spirit, and the Independent does \u201ca disservice to the real principles of conservatism and libertarianism when they champion the intellectually bankrupt Republican platform.\u201d Furthermore, the author blames this perversion of \u201ctrue\u201d conservatism, to which perversion the Independent has purportedly succumbed, on none other than Ronald Reagan (for reasons unknown).\u000aRather than squarely address the rebuttal that the Independent wrote of his column, the author shifts the battle to one over undefined terminology. This shift to the undefined and infinitely flexible has a rhetorical purpose: it helps the author avoid a fact-based discussion and replace the real debate with a series of random and incoherent bursts of unsubstantiated assertion that simply tend to shut-down understanding, if only because the reader can\u2019t imagine where to try to begin. But try we must.\u000aThe only hint that the author gives about what he might mean by \u201cconservative\u201d is that he appears to see liberty as its end goal: \u201c\u2026the Claremont Colleges should embrace the ASA boycott because in doing so, they will be contributing to the preservation of what the liberal arts are truly about: liberty.\u201d But if the supposedly \u201cconservative\u201d principle of boycotting Israeli universities is simply a means toward the end goal of \u201cliberty\u201d (a dubious proposition through and through, but we\u2019ll play along with it), then that would not make the principle conservative in the classical sense at all. Rather, it would almost by definition be liberal in the classical sense (or based on ideas rooted in liberty).\u000aFurthermore, perhaps it is worth asking from whence the author gets the bold idea that pre-Reagan conservatives often took anti-Israel stances. Even if one were to take his claim that perversion of the Republican Party began with Reagan at face value, then would the author have us believe that, say, Richard Nixon was a relentless antagonist of Israel? That\u2019s a somewhat curious suggestion. It is now well known that President Nixon \u2013 a die-hard, pre-Reagan Republican \u2013 threatened thermo-nuclear war (by raising the alert status of U.S. nuclear forces worldwide) to protect Israel and to deter Soviet intervention on the side of an attacking Egyptian army during the Yom Kippur War in 1973. Is that the move of a conservative who would want to boycott Israeli academics? Did the writings of the influential and legendary conservative scholar Irving Kristol, who is also Jewish, indicate some sort of pre-Reagan maliciousness toward Israel? Or maybe the author believes that the father of modern American conservatism and National Review founder William F. Buckley, who was so deeply fond of Israel that he proposed in 1972 that it become the 51st state, secretly held very anti-Israeli sentiments.\u000aBoth in the perfectly malleable and therefore incoherent definition of conservatism he advances and in the entire history he completely overlooks, the author leads his helpless readers on a disorienting tour through the unexplored recesses of his own intellectual idiosyncrasies. But perhaps more important, this debate illustrates exactly why academic freedom should not be treated like just another piece on a political chessboard. By engaging with the author and pointing out the blatant flaws in his reasoning, we actually do more to alleviate fallacious speech than by allowing it to fester beneath the surface unchecked (as Clay Spence expands upon in this issue\u2019s cover article). If the purpose of the liberal arts is to liberate the masses, then its instrument in doing so is truth. And we can only arrive at truth when the free exchange of ideas goes unfettered and academic freedom reigns supreme.\u000a[This article has been edited to correct a misquote in the article referenced.

aS'The Demography Disaster You Weren\xe2\x80\x99t Expecting'
p1110
aVEverything that you know about demography is a lie.\u000aThat\u2019s the message that Weekly Standard writer Jonathan V. Last screams from the mountain tops in What to Expect When No One\u2019s Expecting: America\u2019s Coming Demographic Disaster. By examining unprecedented, worldwide shifts in population trends, such as in fertility rates and societal age structures, Last comes to several gloomy conclusions about where we\u2019re headed \u2013 but not for the reasons you might expect.\u000aLast\u2019s goal is to debunk widely held beliefs about overpopulation, particularly the claims made by author Paul Ehrlich, who plays the villain in Last\u2019s story. Last is the Batman to Ehrlich\u2019s Joker; the Luke Skywalker to his Darth Vader; the Mr. Darcy to his Mr. Wickham.\u000aEhrlich came to international fame and fortune in 1968 when he published his world-wide best-seller, The Population Bomb, which Last jabs at as \u201cone of the most spectacularly foolish books ever published.\u201d And it\u2019s not hard to see why. Ehrlich\u2019s book actually begins: \u201cThe battle to feed humanity is over. In the 1970s the world will undergo famines \u2013 hundreds of millions of people are going to starve to death in spite of any crash programs embarked upon now. At this late date nothing can prevent substantial increase in the world death rate.\u201d\u000aThis book has sold 3 million copies to date. Yet, even today, Ehrlich\u2019s ideas still hold some weight. And perhaps they make intuitive sense. We\u2019re bound to reach our carrying capacity at some point. Overpopulation will naturally lead to resource scarcity, drive down wages, and increase unemployment as too many young people flood the labor market, which will cause global unrest, instability, and violent revolution, so the story goes. Couple all of those factors with increasing worries about a growing population\u2019s effect on environmental degradation and global warming, and you\u2019ve got yourself a doomsday scenario that can go toe-to-toe with the best of \u2018em.\u000aBut Last is not hard on Ehrlich simply because some of his more dramatic predictions have not exactly panned out; rather, Last goes on the full offensive against Ehrlich because at precisely the time that The Population Bomb was hitting bookstands and Ehrlich was getting spots on The Tonight Show with Johnny Carson, the exact opposite of what Ehrlich predicted was happening.\u000aAlthough they had gradually been declining for many years beforehand, right around 1968, world fertility rates actually began to go into free fall.\u000aThe golden number in demography is 2.1. If a country\u2019s Total Fertility Rate (TFR) \u2013 the average number of children a woman can be expected to have by the time she completes her reproductive years assuming the birth rate remains constant throughout \u2013 is above 2.1, then that country\u2019s population will grow; lower, it will shrink; exactly 2.1, and the population will remain constant, which is why the number is often termed the \u201creplacement rate.\u201d\u000aIn 1979, world TFR was 6.0; today, it\u2019s 2.52 \u2013 and rapidly declining. And that 2.52 number is just the average. In many countries, the TFR is substantially lower. Europe is well below the average \u2013 such as in Germany, Italy and Greece, all of which sit at right around 1.4; China, an interesting case study because of its one-child policy, is at 1.55; 30 years ago, Iran\u2019s TFR was soaring at 6.5, but today, it\u2019s below the replacement rate at 1.88. Singapore brings up the global rear at a precariously low 0.79.\u000aAlthough the trend has hit more-developed nations harder and faster on average, the majority of less-developed nations are also exhibiting a similar declining trend. In fact, fertility rates are on a downward trajectory in 97 percent of countries around the world. The only exceptions to the great population crunch are several central- and north-African countries, such as Niger (7.03) and Uganda (6.06).\u000aThe United States, which Last spends the majority of his book discussing, is relatively exceptional (true to form) for a Western nation, sitting at 2.06 \u2013 but much of that can be attributed to a growing Hispanic population, which has a TFR of 2.35 and contributed half of the population growth in the U.S. from 2000 to 2010. The white, middle-class TFR in America more closely resembles those found in Europe, at 1.79.\u000aWhile advocates of Ehrlich\u2019s brand of death by overpopulation see these falling numbers as a good thing, Last believes that greater problems than those promised by overpopulation loom in the shadows of a population that is decreasing. But before delving into what some of those problems may be, it is worth detailing what exactly Last believes has caused fertility rates to reach these historic lows in the last 50 years.\u000aCollege students (and institutions of higher learning themselves) are one of the primary culprits in the era of depopulation. According to Last, higher education has indirectly become one of the most effective forms of birth control in America. The crux of the argument is that couples often put-off having children until they are finished with their educations and well-situated in the workforce. Those four (or more) years of hitting the books, which have become a staple of middle-class life in America, have taken a toll on the number of babies that a family can reasonably be expected to have. Increasing college tuition costs also leave more students straddled with debt by the time they graduate. Many couples are reluctant to start families with a significant amount of debt, pushing the age of family formation back even further.\u000aThe notion that couples don\u2019t want to start families while burdened with debt tells us something: namely, that kids are really, really expensive. By some measures \u2013 when factoring in costs such as paying for college and the lost wages of a spouse who exits the workforce \u2013 it costs an average of $1.1 million to raise a kid in middle-class America today.\u000aThis economic disincentive marks a striking difference in how we view children today and how they have often been looked at throughout human history. There used to be an economic incentive that motivated couples to have children \u2013 the need for someone to take care of them in old age; however, with the advent of the New Deal and programs like Social Security and Medicare, one sees little reason at all, at least when the bottom line is concerned, to have children anymore.\u000aLast even notes that things like car-seat laws have added yet another economic burden on the prospect of having children. It\u2019s not the car seats themselves that are expensive, but the bigger (or additional) cars that car-seat laws force families to buy if they want more than two children. The typical five-seat sedan can only fit two gargantuan booster seats in the back, and some state laws may cause smaller children to use them until they are 12 years old. If a family wants a third child badly enough, they will likely do so regardless of such seemingly trivial extra expenses. After all, what\u2019s a few thousand dollars more on a potentially $1.1 million investment? But the increased cost may cause some families on the margin \u2013 debating whether or not to have number three \u2013 to stick with two. At the very least, it may cause a couple to wait until they are financially better-off to add another member to the family \u2013 closing the fertility window ever more.\u000aLast also spends considerable time on several social phenomena that emerged out of the Cultural Revolution of the 60s and 70s: Higher divorce rates mean couples are splitting up before they would have normally been finished having children; the prevalence of abortion and increased access to birth control have played an obvious role that needs little elaboration; and changing norms about women in the workforce have given many women the choice to put-off having children (or not to have children at all) in favor of beginning their careers.\u000aAttributing declining fertility rates with these phenomena is not to say that many of them have not been an overall boon for both individuals and society as a whole; few would argue that more educational and career opportunities for women are bad things. But, as Last stresses, our attitudes and behaviors toward having children and forming families sit precariously upon a ledge. Even minor changes in cultural norms or seemingly irrelevant policy measures have the ability to tip them right over the edge \u2013 let alone the vast technological and societal revolutions that have upended American culture since the 1960s \u2013 and it\u2019s important to recognize that.\u000a\u201cOK \u2013 so population is actually declining. What\u2019s the problem?\u201d an Ehrlichian might ask at this point. Well, Last provides a few answers in response.\u000aFirst, when a country remains at sub-replacement-level fertility for a prolonged amount of time, eventually the age structure inverts (imagine an upside-down pyramid). Suddenly, the elderly (or those dependent upon the labor and wages of others) outnumber the youthful (or those who provide the labor and wages). To put it in another perspective, in the German city of Westphalia, there are such tremendous labor shortages for workers to take care of retirees that the government started a program to convert prostitutes into elder-care nurses.\u000aAnother problem comes with the benefits that the elderly are dependent upon from the state. When Social Security was first enacted in America, there were 160 workers for every one beneficiary; today, that ratio is approaching just two to one. The state is left with a difficult decision: either cut the benefits that the elderly have been promised (and for which they have paid) or increase the tax burden on the young. Neither solution is particularly optimal for maintaining societal stability.\u000aThe inverted age structure also leads to a second, perhaps more obvious problem: The overall number of people begins to contract and decline as the elderly die off faster than they can be replaced. This phenomenon has hit Germany particularly hard, where, for instance, the city of Hoyerswerda (with a TFR hovering between 0.8 and 1.2 since the fall of the Berlin Wall) has lost half of its population in the last 30 years. The primary role of the Hoyerswerda government today is to demolish buildings in areas that have become ghost towns. More than a third of the housing in Hoyerswerda has been torn down in the last 30 years.\u000aBut these problems (if one can even call the prostitute-to-nurse program a problem) are trivial compared to some of the others associated with a graying population. Primarily, Last argues, an aging population is not conducive to innovation. The elderly do not invest nearly as much as the young, which will lead to shrinking capital pools and opportunities for technological innovation. Furthermore, innovation is a young man\u2019s game. Economists often point to one\u2019s prime innovative years as between 18 and 34, before one has settled into an established niche. With an aging population comes economic stagnation (if not decline) and an across-the-board hit to quality of life. Conservative pundit Mark Steyn summed it up well: \u201cThere is no precedent in human history for economic growth on declining human capital.\u201d\u000aYet, for America, the future remains bright. While world population is expected to peak somewhere around 2050, America\u2019s will keep growing so long as it keeps the proverbial Ellis Island open. A steady flow of immigrants has the ability to curb just about any problem that even the most pessimistic demographer can muster. While conservatives are often quick to harp on the problems associated with illegal immigration (of which there are many legitimate ones, of course), perhaps there will be a time when we desperately want energetic and hard-working young men to cross our borders to take care of our elderly, but we simply won\u2019t be able to entice them to do so.\u000aLast offers a crash course in demography \u2013 spending much of an early chapter going over the basic terminology and equations in the field \u2013 and the oft-overlooked subject\u2019s implications on American politics and culture. Although the subject is serious, the read is enjoyable, and Last is never light on jokes and dry wit. (Chapter names like \u201cSEX!\u201d and \u201cHow to Make Babies\u201d give you an idea of what kind of humor you can expect.) It may not convince you to have a baby yourself, but perhaps it will give you an increased level of appreciation for those who do undertake the not-so-glamorous-but-vitally important task.\u000aShare this:Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)MoreClick to print (Opens in new window)Click to share on Pinterest (Opens in new window)Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)Click to share on Google+ (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Tags: Demography Fertility Jonathan V.

aS'My Day with Peggy Noonan'
p1114
aVI had the wonderful opportunity to spend a day with Peggy Noonan, a prolific  and widely admired columnist for the Wall Street Journal, former speechwriter under President Ronald Reagan, and the best-selling author of eight books on American politics, history, and culture. She has been called \u201cthe voice of our times\u201d by USA Today and is an accomplished and esteemed fixture in American political journalism.\u000aConsidering my inclination toward anything politics, getting to know Ms. Noonan in an intimate and discussion-oriented environment with other Scripps students was an extraordinary experience. The cross-ideological dynamic gave me insights into what makes Ms. Noonan such a successful communicator. She is articulate, passionate, and knowledgeable, but never condescending.\u000aI also had the honor of introducing Ms. Noonan that evening to the greater Claremont community in Garrison Theater. Here she shared her insights and experiences through different political eras dating back to her time in the Reagan administration.\u000aShe also shared some hilarious stories that are worth repeating over and over, like this one:\u000aAfter he lost the 2000 presidential election to George W. Bush, Al Gore went to England to meet with the Queen. While there, he asked her how she would describe her form of governing. The Queen responded that she surrounds herself with smart people and lets them then do their jobs. Gore then asked how she knew if they were smart, which prompted the queen to call in then-Prime Minister Tony Blair and ask him, \u201cIf your parents had a child who was not your brother or sister who would it be?\u201d to which he responded, \u201cMe.\u201d After returning to Washington, Gore called President George W. Bush and asked him the same question the Queen had asked Tony Blair. President Bush was perplexed and asked if he could get back to Gore. Bush and his staff discussed the question, but they could not figure it out. Eventually, he turned to then-Secretary of State Collin Powell for help,  who responded, \u201cIt\u2019s me, of course.\u201d Bush then called Gore back and said the answer to his question is Collin Powell, to which Gore responded, \u201cNo, it\u2019s not him. It\u2019s Tony Blair.\u201d\u000aMs. Noonan said that this story was too good to check the validity of, and I am going to go with that, too.\u000aThe most popular topic of the night was the 2016 presidential election. Ms. Noonan was not bashful in her suspicion that New Jersey Governor Chris Christie may not travel  and appeal to voters all around the country particularly well.\u000aWe also talked briefly about that classic Republican question of how the GOP could reach out to different demographics better. She responded that the party needs to focus more on middle- and working-class. Once the base of the party is there, other groups will naturally be attracted. She also said that it would help if prominent party leaders would stop making unfortunate gaffes that have become all-too-common in the Republican Party of late, such as saying that 47 percent of Americans would never vote for a Republican. She also noted that Tea Party politicians should be weary of reporters trying to bait them into saying stupid or controversial things.\u000aThe Elizabeth Hubert Malott speaker series envisioned bringing speakers to campus who would inspire informed debate on a range of public policy issues and expose Scripps students to the conservative point of view seldom heard within academia.\u000aAs one of the few Scripps students who identifies as conservative, my day with Peggy was a refreshing change of pace to the conversations that usually dominate the campus dialogue.\u000aDavid Brooks, who was the series\u2019 speaker in 2011, called Scripps students \u201cfiendishly bright\u201d after his time on campus. Ms. Noonan fittingly concurred, noting that she would call Scripps students \u201cdevlishly brilliant.\u201d But one would not get to see this side of Scripps students without an opposing point of view to bring out the best in us.\u000aShare this:Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)MoreClick to print (Opens in new window)Click to share on Pinterest (Opens in new window)Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)Click to share on Google+ (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Tags: Peggy NoonanCategories: Campus News

aS'The Jobless Generation: How Obama\xe2\x80\x99s State of the Union Address Ignores America\xe2\x80\x99s Young Adults'
p1118
aVNo, you did not misread the title. After Obama\u2019s State of the Union (SOTU) speech, millennial Democrats on campus (and nationwide) were quick to say how Obama\u2019s proposed policies would help everyone in the nation, including individuals their age. But, if you look a bit deeper, all is not as it seems. In reality, Obama\u2019s policies do not help the job prospects of young Americans who are looking to find their first full-time jobs.\u000aAt the moment, job prospects for millennials are quite bleak. According to the Generation Opportunity, in January 2014 the unemployment rate of 19-31 year olds, not including those who have given up on looking for work, is 15.8%, which is nearly triple the national unemployment rate of 6.6%. This is extremely worrying, as a study done by Dr. Meg Jay has found that almost two-thirds of an individual\u2019s lifetime wage growth comes from their 20\u2019s. This means that millennials who are out of work now will face an uphill battle to gain any percentage of the wage they could have earned if they would have found a job earlier. Unfortunately, even in the face of these concerning statistics, Obama has chosen to focus on policies that sound good in theory, but actually further damage, the job prospects of millennials.\u000aObama has been widely applauded by Democrats on campus for his efforts to raise the Federal minimum wage and, therefore, help upward mobility in the lower classes. In theory, this sounds great for millennials who are just starting to work in, say, a burger joint. However, a study done by Claremont McKenna College Professor Manfred Keil, has shown that an increase in the minimum wage has a negative effect on the employment of workers aged 20-24. Furthermore, Keil has found that increasing minimum wage has no effect on the employment of those aged over 24. These findings suggest that increasing minimum wage encourages firms that employ minimum wage workers to hire millennials on a part-time contract, if they hire them at all, since it is cheaper for firms to only pay the increased minimum wage to the workers they already have (who they cannot easily force into a part-time role).\u000aIn his speech, Obama also focused on plans to help the long-term unemployed to get people back to work. Obama spoke about agreements he made with companies such as AT&T and Bank of America, which entailed signing a pledge to not discriminate against the long-term unemployed in their hiring process. While this might not seem to affect younger workers, encouraging firms to hire long-term unemployed individuals just pushes millennials, who presumably have less experience than long-term unemployed workers, further down the list of individuals that firms will hire.\u000aSource: Bureau of Labor Statistics\u000aThere are two other important factors that have been negatively affecting young job seekers that Obama did not address in his speech. Millennial job prospects are currently being hurt by baby boomers working for more years before retiring. While this trend might reduce the current amount of welfare that the state and Federal governments need to pay out to retirees, baby boomers keep millennials out of jobs since firms find it easier and cheaper to keep current employees (who do not need to be trained and already have work experience) and ignore millennials who would like to get into the job market. This crowding out of millennial job seekers has a negative effect on the government\u2019s ability to pay welfare for any social group, since millennials who do not have jobs cannot pay taxes. In addition, Obama\u2019s public healthcare law has encouraged businesses to hire millennials only on a part-time basis in order to avoid having to provide health insurance to them. Since millennials are the most expendable workers with the least bargaining power, there is little that they can do to convince a cost-cutting firm to hire them full-time.\u000aOverall, it is quite worrying to see millennial Democrats blindly believe that what Obama is doing is best for people our age. It would be more beneficial for the country as a whole if Obama, and Congress, were to enact policies that encourage firms to hire new millennial workers, as they will form the foundation of the job force for years to come. If not, the USA will find itself with a generation that lives off welfare checks and their parents\u2019 retirement funds in their parents\u2019 homes. In a country that is already trillions of dollars in debt, the last thing we need is for young, able-bodied individuals to give up on finding a job.\u000aShare this:Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)MoreClick to print (Opens in new window)Click to share on Pinterest (Opens in new window)Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)Click to share on Google+ (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Tags: Labor Force Millenial Minimum Wage Obama UnemploymentCategories: Opinion

aS'Boycotting Israeli Academics? A Response to TSL'
p1122
aVThe American Studies Association (ASA), a scholarly group that publishes American Quarterly, announced in a statement Dec. 16 that it \u201cendorses and will honor the call of Palestinian civil society for a boycott of Israeli academic institutions. It is also resolved that the ASA supports the protected rights of students and scholars everywhere to engage in research and public speaking about Israel-Palestine and in support of the boycott, divestment, and sanctions (BDS) movement.\u201d\u000aThe ASA\u2019s statement was strongly criticized by the greater world of academia, with dozens of universities and university presidents, including Pomona\u2019s President Oxtoby, condemning the move. President Sean Decatur of Kenyon College stated that the boycott contradicted the concept of academic freedom, which he defined as \u201cthe unfettered exchange of ideas.\u201d\u000aThis response repudiated the burgeoning movement in some realms of academia to define academic freedom as \u201cthe unfettered exchange of ideas \u2013 so long as those ideas adhere to a left-liberal orthodoxy. If not, utilize the existence of right-leaning beliefs to infer a degree of moral turpitude upon the person and engage in thinly veiled ad hominem.\u201d\u000aAdmittedly this interpretation was also limited by its verbosity, but it still apparently holds some sway in the precincts of Pomona College, where an Opinions writer in the Feb. 7 issue of The Student Life took issue with President Oxtoby and dozens of other universities\u2019 stance on the importance of academic freedom.\u000aThere seems to be some confusion on the part of this column about the facts on the ground. The author declared that Israel has \u201cone of the most illiberal systems of education,\u201d but then completely failed to mention a single university located inside the nation of Israel and seemed to interpret border security measures between warring states as a direct attack on Palestinian academia, and not as a larger part of being in a state of combat. In addition, the author does not mention that, at Israeli universities, students are admitted regardless of ethnicity or faith. Nor does the author mention that these institutions actually practice affirmative action to increase Arab attendance. In addition, the \u201cmost illiberal\u201d charge becomes laughable when one considers that Israel has a free press and strongly independent judiciary, and that most of its neighbors are dictatorships that do impose limits on the press and academics, and engage in actual political oppression (see Iran\u2019s hanging of sexual and political dissidents; Egypt\u2019s targeting of Christians; everything Syria has done recently, etc.).\u000aThis confusion continues as the author notes that Israel\u2019s activities \u201chave been likened to those of South African apartheid.\u201d The passive voice here is important, because the author can simply make the insinuation without substantiating it in any way. To clarify, ethnic minorities in Israel can serve in government, vote, and benefit from Israeli social services. The only conceivable similarity is that the bulk of Palestinians are physically separated from the Israelis, but unlike South Africa, their separation stems from the fact that they have two (or three, depending on how one categorizes the Hamas-Fatah split) de facto national governments and distinct, if disputed, territory. The two are in conflict with one another, but the history, attitudes, and policies are very different from those in South Africa.\u000aThe writer also trotted out a point that claims Israel has violated more UN resolutions than any other nation. What he does not explain is that these resolutions were issued primarily by the General Assembly, a generally petty and vindictively political body, and were also non-binding, a term that should not need defining but apparently has some nuance that escaped our TSL author. The only thing this little statistic tells us is that the General Assembly has a disproportionate interest in the nation of Israel. In addition, the UN frequently ignores the transgressions of its authoritarian member-states in favor of attacking the politically vulnerable. For example, in a recent report, the UN Committee on the Rights of the Child condemned the Holy See for its treatment of children and further demanded that the Vatican abandon several of its long-held political and moral positions in favor of the UN doctrine. It is rather surprising that this was the most pressing issue for this UN committee, but considering that it is made up of members from human rights stalwarts such as Russia, Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, Tunisia, Sri Lanka, Egypt, and until last year, Syria, its judgments should probably just be held as sacrosanct. In reality, however, the UN is hardly an authoritative body to appeal to in this instance.\u000aNone of this is to say that Israel is blameless, or that it has not committed transgressions in this conflict. Very few countries can actually claim and hold the moral high ground, and attempting to develop a simple \u201cgood/bad\u201d dichotomy, on either side, serves no practical purpose. To do so would simply drive one party from the negotiating table. This is the primary issue with the ASA\u2019s boycott and the TSL author\u2019s support for it. The boycott attempts to ideologically isolate one side, which will likely lead to belief polarization and continued conflict. This is a region with political, religious and ethnic conflicts that span millennia. However, the TSL author seems to think that isolating Israel further will make them more likely to negotiate. This seems unlikely, because while the author heavily emphasized the Palestinian liberty interests, he failed to note that the Israelis also have pressing liberty and security concerns. The Israelis are already isolated, considering that countries that they have fought against on multiple occasions in the last 70 years surround them. In addition, several of their neighbors have also denied their right to exist at various points in time. Isolating them further will not convince them of the security of their position, nor is it at all justified in the context of this conflict. Free academic exchanges will keep international influence ensconced in both countries and improve the likelihood of a real solution. Only an incredibly tendentious reading of history can justify defining this conflict in an absurdly simple and dualistic manner and make a boycott a reasonable response. A real solution means bringing both sides into negotiations, not just one.\u000a[This article has been edited to reflect the fact that The Student Life article referenced is an opinion piece rather than a news article.]\u000aShare this:Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)MoreClick to print (Opens in new window)Click to share on Pinterest (Opens in new window)Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)Click to share on Google+ (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Tags: Isreal SJP TSLCategories: Opinion Rebuttal

aS'Going Postal'
p1126
aVThe United States Postal Service (USPS) posted an improvement in its first quarter fiscal numbers this year \u2013 by posting a $354 million deficit. This number is an improvement because, a year ago, the USPS posted a $1.3 billion loss during its first quarter, which adds up to losses in 19 of the last 21 fiscal quarters.\u000aThe USPS is turning into a colossal liability that will soon translate into a government bailout if something is not done quickly. While partisan ideologies stand in the way of any meaningful reform, it is the consensus that Congress needs to take some sort of action to stop the financial hemorrhage that has become the national Postal Service.\u000aThe fall of the USPS has been a result of the decline in the use of physical \u201csnail mail\u201d as the primary form of correspondence, in favor of email and other web-based alternatives. The Postal Service woes are translating into higher prices for consumers. At the beginning of February, the price of first-class mail rose $.03, from $.46 to $.49.\u000aWhile the rise in price may seem minimal, it actually indicates a serious problem for the Postal Service. USPS Board of Governors Chairman Mickey D. Barnett states that prices only increase due to the postal service\u2019s \u201cprecarious financial condition.\u201d Postal service rates usually rise in accordance with the annual raise in the consumer price index (CPI), which measures the price of the typical basket of goods that a consumer will buy in a given year. This usually results in an annual 0.1 percent hike in the price of stamps, but the raise this year was equal to almost 6.5 percent \u2013 a price change that indicates a drastic measure to remain financially solvent.\u000aA recent NBC News article states that \u201c[t]he USPS last increased prices for a first-class stamp by a penny in January of this year. At the time, the USPS cited losses of about $25 million per day amid declining mail volume as more people use email and social media.\u201d\u000aIn addition to posting tremendous losses, the USPS has now asked for a bailout from Congress. Postmaster General Patrick Donahoe says the USPS will default on $5.7 billion retiree health benefit prepayments without governmental support.\u000a\u201cWe cannot return the organization to long-term financial stability without passage of comprehensive postal reform legislation,\u201d Donahoe said. \u201cWe appreciate the efforts of the House and Senate oversight committees to make this happen as soon as possible.\u201d\u000aOne solution slowly gaining momentum is the movement to privatize the USPS. To this point, the Postal Service has been operating as a monopoly. Because they can always fall back on public support regardless of if they provide certain services efficiently and effectively, the Postal Service has little incentive to do just that. The lack of competition has allowed the USPS to compile losses and receive congressional help without any real efforts at improving their operating procedures or appeal to consumer tastes. While some point to congressional help as the solution to the national mail service\u2019s woes, others believe that privatization would remove the thorn in the Postal Service\u2019s side \u2013 namely, Congress itself.\u000aNew York Times columnist Joe Nocera makes this point, writing that \u201cneither the management nor the workers really control the Postal Service. Even though the post office has been self-financed since the 1980s, it remains shackled by Congress, which simply can\u2019t bring itself to allow the service to make its own decisions. And Congress won\u2019t do so, as long as the post office remains part of the government.\u201d\u000aThe United Kingdom just finished the process of privatizing their mail service, Royal Mail, and The Economist reports the transition thus far as a success: \u201cA freed-up Royal Mail will compete with dozens of nifty competitors for its parcels business, as well as with a new breed of \u2018lifestyle couriers,\u2019 who trundle around goods ordered on the Web.\u201d\u000aIn other countries, such as the Netherlands, Germany, and Austria, privatization of the mail service has resulted in lower prices across the board for consumers.\u000aMichael Taube of the Washington Times writes, \u201cOpening up the free market to private enterprise would ensure that real competition exists for mail delivery and postage rates. More businesses and jobs would be created in a thriving marketplace.\u201d\u000aIn the past five years, mail volume has fallen by more than 20 percent, and USPS revenue has fallen by more than 12 percent. Partisan gridlock has stalled any meaningful reform, and workers are being released as demand for their labor decreases. Chairman of the Financial Strategy and Solutions Group at Citigroup Peter Orszag summarizes: \u201cThe U.S. Postal Service has a long and storied history. Yet it is now struggling because the world has changed and because congressional sclerosis has prevented it from adapting to the new realities. The best way to modernize it now is to move it out of the government.\u201d\u000aThe story of the U.S. Postal Service is not just one of letters and stamps \u2013 it\u2019s one that speaks to a greater lesson that Americans should not be quick to forget. Although there are those who propagate the necessity of more government it is often the bureaucracies created under all-expansive governments that countermine the necessity of such ideals. Such institutionalized bureaucracies are slow to respond to consumer pressures and changing tastes, and, more times than not, prevent true innovation from taking place.\u000aShare this:Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)MoreClick to print (Opens in new window)Click to share on Pinterest (Opens in new window)Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)Click to share on Google+ (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Tags: Congress Postal Service USPSCategories: Opinion

p1130
aVIn a recent Super Bowl Sunday interview with Fox News Channel\u2019s Bill O\u2019Reilly, President Obama essentially proclaimed that he was no more liberal than President Richard Nixon. Although such a comparison should be left to the historians, it appears Nixon and Obama actually do share something quite similar: abysmally low approval ratings. In fact, President Obama entered January with the lowest approval rating after the fifth year of a presidency since Tricky Dick himself, who at the time happened to be embroiled in a little scandal known as Watergate. While it\u2019s all great that Obama joyously sang Kumbaya at his most recent State of the Union address, it is time for the President to accept the reality of his situation. The upcoming 2014 Senate elections are the only thing that can possibly salvage his presidency and allow him to escape the political Armageddon that ravaged President Bush.\u000aMost political pundits assert that the Republicans will very likely maintain control of the House of Representatives in the upcoming midterms. As a result, if Republicans were to assume control of the Senate as well, Obama\u2019s second term agenda is essentially a moot point.\u000aIt appears that the President has indeed come to terms with the ominous political landscape, as a recent Politico report notes that Obama recently met with vulnerable Democratic senators, reassuring them that one of his primary goals is maintaining Democratic control of the Senate. On an embarrassing note, a CNN report states that Obama has even vowed to distance himself from races in states where his approval rating is anemic.\u000aIt is true that Democrats have a phenomenal grassroots operation, and recent Republican Senate candidates have consisted of individuals who have made downright idiotic comments that cost them seats once thought to be locks; however, the political calculus for Democrats is undeniably grim.\u000aRepublicans need a net gain of six seats in order to assume control of the Senate. Currently, there are two legitimate opportunities for Democrats to take control of a Republican-held seat.\u000aIn Kentucky, Republican Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell will face tough opponents both in the primary and general elections. But considering that in 2012 Obama didn\u2019t even eclipse 40 percent of the vote in Kentucky, a Democratic victory is a dubious proposition at best. Moreover, given the magnitude of this particular race, the Republican establishment will funnel millions of dollars into the reelection campaign.\u000aThe second opportunity for Democrats to flip a seat comes in Georgia, where a heated Republican primary is expected to take place and a burgeoning Hispanic and African-American population is quickly turning the state purple. Although we won\u2019t be able to forecast this race with much degree of certainty until the candidates are more set in stone, the Peach State still voted Romney by nearly 8 points in 2012, so a slight edge still has to be given to Republicans.\u000aThe best opportunities for Republicans to pick up the necessary six seats are in the following states: Arkansas, Louisiana, North Carolina, West Virginia, Alaska, South Dakota and Montana.\u000aArkansas is widely projected as an unequivocal slam dunk for Republicans. Incumbent Democrat Mark Pryor is taking on Tom Cotton, a Harvard Law-educated Iraq and Afghanistan veteran who is beloved by the Tea Party and establishment (and interestingly a Claremont Graduate University alumnus). Already trailing in the polls, Senator Pryor is scrambling to avoid any associations with the President as well as disavow his 2010 vote for Obamacare. Regardless, his chances are slim at best, especially in a state where Obama failed to garner even 40 percent of the vote in 2012.\u000aIncumbent Democrat Mary Landrieu of Louisiana is also in grave danger of losing her Senate seat. Given that the Bayou state voted for Romney by a margin of 17 points in 2012, Landrieu\u2019s recent reaffirmation of her 2010 Obamacare vote will likely not bode well with voters. Despite the inherent advantage of being an incumbent, Landrieu is already trailing her likely Republican foe, U.S. Representative Bill Cassidy. However, as the sister of the current Mayor of New Orleans and someone who has held her Senate seat since 1997, Landrieu is no political amateur. In fact, she is currently seeking to score some major political capital by spearheading a flood insurance bill that would especially benefit Louisianans. In the end, despite her politically savvy efforts, it is doubtful Landrieu will overcome the vast anti-Obamacare sentiment, which to date has claimed the Senate seats formerly held by Ted Kennedy and even Barack Obama himself.\u000aKay Hagan rode the coattails of Obama\u2019s 2008 election grandeur into her current North Carolina Senate seat. However, it looks like what goes around comes around, as Hagan is now seeking to distance herself from the toxicity of Obamacare, which already has her trailing her Republican adversaries in the polls.\u000aSenator Mark Begich of Alaska is in a similar predicament, as he finds himself defending his Obamacare vote in a heavily red state where the President has dismally low approval ratings.\u000aIn West Virginia, retiring Democrat Senator Jay Rockefeller (the only elected Democrat from the Rockefeller family) is essentially rolling out the red carpet for a Republican successor. President Obama\u2019s less than 30 percent approval rating in West Virginia, which he can attribute to his administration\u2019s assault on the coal industry, is certainly ominous for any Democrat seeking the seat.\u000aIn South Dakota, former Republican Governor Mike Rounds is projected to waltz into the Senate vacancy created by another retiring Democrat, as he currently leads potential Democrat opponents by wide margins.\u000aIn nearby Montana, U.S. Representative Steve Daines is leading his Democratic challenger for a Senate seat vacated by Max Baucus, who was recently tapped as the U.S. ambassador to China.\u000aIn addition to these seven races, there are several other legitimate opportunities for Republicans to pick up additional Senate seats or make up for any unforeseen mishaps (which are not uncommon in the Republican Party). In New Hampshire, Republican Scott Brown (who famously won the late Ted Kennedy\u2019s Senate seat) is already tied with the incumbent Democrat in the polls, despite not even announcing his candidacy. Moreover, the Senate races in Iowa and Michigan, where incumbent Democrats are retiring, are projected to be competitive races.\u000aThe potential consequences for Democrats in the upcoming Senate elections are monumental. Should Republicans takes full control of Congress, the President would be viewed as the primary source of partisan gridlock, as he would find himself daily vetoing GOP bills aimed to reduce our annual deficits and national debt. Given that Obama rammed through Congress numerous bills in his first two years without an ounce of bipartisan support, don\u2019t expect Republicans to succumb to the President\u2019s half-hearted attempts for compromise. More important, the upcoming elections could provide the infrastructure for a quasi-Reagan Revolution in 2016, should a Republican assume control of the White House (or, in a worst-case scenario, mitigate a Hillary Clinton presidency).\u000aLiberals need to brace themselves. Say goodbye to the New Deal gravy train and hello to fiscal responsibility. 2014 is the GOP\u2019s for the taking.\u000aShare this:Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)MoreClick to print (Opens in new window)Click to share on Pinterest (Opens in new window)Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)Click to share on Google+ (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Tags: 2014 Midterm Elections SenateCategories: Opinion

aS'CI Staff Oscar Predictions'
p1134
aVMovie stars, directors, and producers enter Hollywood\u2019s Dolby Theatre tonight in hopes of securing one of the few golden statuettes affectionately known as \u201cOscar.\u201d The 86th Academy Awards will invoke both enchantment and contempt from movie aficionados everywhere, as legendary icons in the film industry are celebrated, and fan-favorites are left sitting awkwardly in their red-velvet chairs. Alexandra Holterman and Brad Richardson give us the night\u2019s winners and losers:\u000aBest Picture\u000a(A): The most successful of the Best Picture-nominated films at the box office, Gravity  will have similar success at the Oscars. Gravity  was widely praised by critics for its cinematography and rising, yet subtle, tension.\u000a(B): I like Twelve Years a Slave to take the gold (the golden statuette, that is) for Best Picture. Oscar voters like to make the awards matter, and Twelve Years is the most significant film of the Best Picture bunch. Look out for Dallas Buyers Club as a dark-horse candidate.\u000aBest Director\u000a(A): A low-earning movie, Nebraska is likely to be snubbed at this year\u2019s awards; however, hopefully that doesn\u2019t apply to director Alexander Payne, whose work on the enjoyable drama-comedy deserves recognition.\u000a(B): Alfonso Cuarón painted a masterpiece when it came to the visual elements and style in Gravity. Although this movie feels a bit like a 2014 version of Avatar, I think Cuarón did enough to take home the award on technical merit alone in a wide-open Best Director field.\u000aBest Actor\u000a(A): Leonard DiCaprio finally takes the trophy home. Nominated three other times for Best Actor, Leo has never won, but his convincing performance as Jordan Belfort in The Wolf of Wall Street will break the streak.\u000a(B): There seems to be a positive correlation between how often Matthew McConaughey can keep his shirt on and the quality of his on-screen performances. This wardrobe trend should culminate in a Best Actor award for his mostly shirted lead role in Dallas Buyers Club.\u000aBest Actress\u000a(A): Another previously nominated first-timer, Amy Adams, will take home the award for Best Actress. Adams\u2019 work in American Hustle, which had her switching between accents and rocking 70s-style cleavage, is more than deserving of the award.\u000a(B): As an avid Amy Adams fan, I am hopelessly and blindly biased when it comes to this category. And now that I\u2019ve acknowledged it, I\u2019m still picking Adams for her role in American Hustle over front-runner Cate Blanchett (Blue Jasmine), anyway.\u000aBest Supporting Actor\u000a(A): For the role of an HIV-positive, drug-addicted, transgender woman, Rayon, in Dallas Buyers Club, Jared Leto stopped eating to lose 30 pounds (a feat also accomplished by the aforementioned McConaughey). Leto\u2019s dedication to the role comes through in his fantastically tragic performance.\u000a(B): Dallas Buyers Club takes both awards for the male performance tonight, as front-runner Leto is a near-lock for his equally persuasive role opposite McConaughey.\u000aBest Supporting Actress\u000a(A): In one of the best performances of the year, Lupita Nyong\u2019o should take home the award for the deep and emotional role as a young slave named Patsey in Twelve Years a Slave.\u000a(B): Although Jennifer Lawrence is extremely deserving of the award for her work in American Hustle, it\u2019s simply too much too soon for the 22-year old actress. Fellow front-runner Nyong\u2019o has the advantage, as her equally deserving role in Twelve Years a Slave is also the first major one for the previously little-known Kenyan actress.\u000aShare this:Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)MoreClick to print (Opens in new window)Click to share on Pinterest (Opens in new window)Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)Click to share on Google+ (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Categories: Opinion

aS'Externalizing Risk Over Common Sense: CMC DOS\xe2\x80\x99 Shifting Priorities'
p1138
aV\u201cI\u2019m going to move off-campus next year because, before you know it, this campus is going to be completely dry.\u201d\u000aThis sort of talk, which was unthinkable even a few short years ago, has become common at Claremont McKenna College, as students have begun to feel helpless in the face of a draconian Dean of Students office (DOS). What began as simple disbelief and confusion after the dodgeball tournament \u201cRage in the Cage\u201d was canceled on Nov. 1 has progressed to disillusionment about the very fabric of CMC\u2019s culture.\u000aOn that now-infamous day, the DOS went from approving a registered, dry party to telling students to go drink in their rooms. According to CMC\u2019s current Student Activities Chair (SAC), Mark Blumenfeld, this drastic shift seemed to have happened completely abruptly, as he was only made aware of the cancellation the day before the event was to occur. Due to this last-minute change of plans, CMC students who had been planning on going out Saturday evening were forced to find a way find a new venue in which to entertain themselves.\u000aThis resulted in a North Quad gathering, which was perfectly normal by 5C standards. Even though, as per usual, steps were taken by the SAC and various RAs to make sure the party stayed safe, such as moving students outside of lounges to prevent property damage and student injury, it was personally shut down by Dean Spellman and Dean Voss because, in a bit of bureaucratic irony, the gathering was not registered properly. When asked what they should do now, students were told by Dean Vos to \u201cgo drink in your rooms.\u201d\u000aThat night, the Deans made the collective, decisive and unmistakably clear choice to prioritize reducing legal liability over student safety and, consequently, the culture that has made CMC the happiest college in the U.S. While the night of Nov. 2 aptly epitomizes the current stance of the Dean of Students office toward the CMC social scene, the decision to shut down the party is only a small step in the CMC administration\u2019s longer term change in policy with regards to the social scene.. This, however, is not a change in CMC\u2019s rules, which have always complied with local, state, and national laws.\u000aAs far as the administration is concerned, it would be better for CMCers to create fraternities so that, should anything happen to a student, the parents (and college) could sue the fraternity. Unfortunately, this goal goes directly against what CMC has and should stand for, student safety. What was great about CMC was its mature, rational, and open view of drinking, preferring to help students in trouble rather than leaving them in their rooms by themselves. But, by implementing policies that encourage students to drink in private, the administration is promoting an unrestrained binge-drinking culture. In their rooms, with nothing to do, students will look to excessive, private drinking as a replacement to what used to be a vibrant social life at CMC.\u000aThe administration\u2019s new hardline against CMC\u2019s social culture is a self-fulfilling prophecy. As discussed above, by attempting to reduce legal risk, the administration\u2019s actions will result in more instances of hospital transports and alcohol poisoning than ever before. Of course, they will then try to blame the students and put in place further restrictions on the social scene in the name of \u201cprevention,\u201d which will begin a terrible cycle that threatens to undermine student safety and destroy the social culture.\u000aWe have already seen this happen. Even though the DOS has taken a noticeably harder line on alcohol and partying this semester, according to the SAC, Toga Party resulted in five hospital transports, (a new record number of transports for one party at CMC). Consequently, DOS decided to blame the student body and placed further restrictions on the social scene (as seen on Nov. 1) without thinking about who would have been there to help if these five transported students had been drinking in their rooms instead of at Toga?\u000aUnfortunately, though, all of the student frustration over these misguided and dangerous policies seems to be in vain. As expressed to me by the SAC, the DOS has been exceedingly difficult to talk to this semester, especially compared to previous years. For example, the SAC told me that he has been turned away from scheduled meetings with the DOS on multiple occasions. He has effectively been \u201cstonewalled,\u201d even though he is the student body\u2019s elected representative and main point of contact with the administration regarding the social culture.\u000aAnd it\u2019s not just the SAC who is having trouble talking to the DOS. We at the Claremont Independent have tried multiple times to talk with the DOS only to be rejected or, usually, completely ignored. So much for the idea of that \u201csafe and welcoming place\u201d that the DOS so cheerfully claims to be on its website.\u000aIn my discussion with the SAC, the only hope he had for the future was that the Alcohol Taskforce, a committee whose purpose would be to \u201cdiscuss alcohol and campus life in greater depth than had been reviewed before\u201d and submit a report to CMC President Chodosh, would be reinstated, and that the DOS would actually listen to its findings. This is similar to Chodosh\u2019s recently proposed \u201calcohol and drugs subcommittee\u201d that he proposed to in an email to the CMC student body on November 22. In light of the DOS completely shrugging off students\u2019 views this semester, however, the potential effectiveness of the subcommittee, or taskforce, is limited at best. The best-remaining hope is that the Board of Trustees, who dictate how the DOS should act, decide to change the administration\u2019s policy that is crushing the inclusive and safe social culture that CMCers past and present so dearly love. In the end, CMC is only as good as its students and their well-being, a lesson that the DOS has been slow to learn and quick to forget.\u000aShare this:Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)MoreClick to print (Opens in new window)Click to share on Pinterest (Opens in new window)Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)Click to share on Google+ (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Tags: Claremont McKenna College Dean of Students Dean Spellman Mark Blumenfeld Rage in the CageCategories: Campus News Opinion

aS'Why Conservatives Should Support Teach For America'
p1142
aVWith the Teach For America (TFA) January application deadline fast approaching, dozens of students across the Claremont Colleges are no doubt considering whether or not they want to have a role in TFA\u2019s continuing mission of closing the \u201ceducation gap.\u201d\u000aAs a general rule, the majority of students who accept the two-year commitment of managing a classroom in one of America\u2019s toughest schools will identify as Democrats. This is not surprising considering that the mind behind the idea, Wendy Kopp, modeled TFA after an organization that is the archetype for liberal volunteerism.\u000aKopp dreamed up the idea of creating a Peace Corps-like program that catered to low-income American school children while she was writing her senior thesis at Princeton. Her paper soon materialized into a not-for-profit organization that she envisioned \u201cwould mobilize some of the most passionate, dedicated members of [her] generation to change the fact that where a child is born in the United States largely determines his or her chances in life.\u201d\u000aOver 20 years later, TFA has graduated 24,000 corps members and has touched more than three million children. Its dream of reforming the education system and focusing on troubled minority youth has won it accolades from the liberal royalty, including President Barack Obama, Rep. John Lewis (D-GA), Malcolm Gladwell, Gloria Steinem, and TFA board member John Legend.\u000aBut beneath the idealistic, even utopian, rhetoric, bright-eyed liberal corps members are pursuing an agenda that is deeply conservative in both its philosophy and teaching strategy.\u000aInstead of studying poverty from a college textbook, corps members are thrown into the trenches of the American public education system. With this hands-on approach, they become eyewitnesses to the challenges, the horrors, and the list of uncomfortable realities that plague public inner city and rural K-12 schools. Although corps members empathize with their students many emotional scars, TFA instructs its teachers not to pigeonhole students as victims, but to hold them to the same standards as every other child in America. TFA cautions that if you expect them to accomplish less than suburban children, then they will.\u000aThe organization stresses that teachers have a better understanding of the needs of their students and their students\u2019 community than a political tsar in Washington trying to construct education policy without ever having worn the hat of a teacher at a Title 1 school. In other words, it cultivates a healthy skepticism of third party attempts to control the structure of individual schools.\u000aTFA also poses a threat to the union bosses who have milked the government for billions of dollars in funding, using the cash only to protect a system that accepts subpar teaching standards as the norm. Corps members enter the classroom with less experience, but often times with more ambition and grit, making the case that the most tenured teachers are not always the most effective.\u000aCorps members are also major feeders into the teacher unions\u2019 biggest adversary \u2013 charter schools. At these government-funded but autonomously operated establishments, teachers, administrators, and parents are bringing innovation into the classrooms. With fewer funds, but less red tape, many charter school experiments are producing test scores and graduation rates that are much higher than the neighboring run-of-the-mill public schools.\u000aAs someone who drank the TFA Kool-Aid and decided, on a whim, to accept a position as a teacher in Houston, I recognize that the organization is highly imperfect and occasionally sends its corps members into impossible or unsustainable situations. However, the organization is a means of challenging the status quo. Its core mission of giving every child access to a quality education regardless of their zip code is a noble endeavor supported by most across the political spectrum. Yet, it is the organization\u2019s conservative mindset and method with which they pursue this goal that should garner the support of anyone who believes a system of personal responsibility and limited government is the structure that best serves the American people and our children.\u000aShare this:Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)MoreClick to print (Opens in new window)Click to share on Pinterest (Opens in new window)Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)Click to share on Google+ (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Tags: Education Teach For America Teacher Unions TFACategories: Guest Opinion Opinion

aS'Featured Organization: The 5C Mental Health Alliance'
p1146
aVThe 5C Mental Health Alliance (MHA) is a student-led organization that seeks to erase the stigma around mental illness at the Claremont Colleges. MHA\u2019s primary mission this year is to promote student dialogue regarding mental illness throughout the 5Cs by facilitating panel discussions, inviting speakers, writing publications, and providing a safe space for students with mental health concerns.\u000aThis fall, events have included a \u201cTherapy Myth-busters\u201d panel discussion, which unraveled common misconceptions regarding the practice of therapy, and an \u201cExploring Mental Illness\u201d screening, which educated students on different types of mental illnesses. MHA has also organized a student panel called \u201cStudents Speak!\u201d where students from the 5C\u2019s shared their personal experiences dealing with mental health issues in an effort to \u201chumanize\u201d mental health cases.\u000aAlong with encouraging healthy student discourse, MHA pursued additional resources for students in need of mental health services at the 5Cs.\u000a\u201cPart of what prompted me to broaden the mission to increase resources for treating mental illnesses on campus is because, at many of our meetings in the past, we have gotten complaints from people saying Monsour, in many cases, was overbooked or provided inadequate treatment.\u201d MHA President Colin Belanger PO \u201914 said.\u000aBelanger said that MHA seeks to find as many ways as possible to meet the needs of students in distress by helping them find the right kind of support they need.\u000aExpectations are high for students at the Claremont Colleges, and feeling stressed out and even overwhelmed is par for the course. Students can change how we deal with these expectations, however, by supporting an environment that fosters a healthy student population. By decreasing the stigma associated with mental illness and by increasing access to different treatments and services, 5C students can make a significant impact in how mental health concerns are viewed and addressed in our community.\u000a\u201cThis [issue] concerns a lot of students on campus \u2013 I\u2019d really like to see that change,\u201d Belanger said.\u000aThe 5C Mental Health Alliance meets every Thursday at 7:00 P.M. in Smith Campus Center\u2019s Room 212 at Pomona College.

aVWatching a loved one struggle with a deteriorating mental health is a unique sort of pain. In my experience, it is akin to watching someone slowly tear themselves apart and being helpless to do anything to stop it.\u000aThis pain came to me in the form of an older sister with Bipolar Disorder.\u000aThe transition from the carefree halls of grade school to the cruel world of high school lived up to its reputation. Seemingly overnight, my sister\u2019s eccentric and quirky personality became mania. Her occasional mood swings morphed into an emotional state that lived solely on the extremities, and her rebellious streak turned into a revolution.\u000aTwelve-year-old me didn\u2019t know what to do, and I\u2019m not sure that the 21-year-old version would be much better equipped. That feeling of helplessness eventually led to anxiety and paranoia. Any time I heard muffled conversations and rushed footsteps outside my door at night, I assumed the worst. Years of suspense took their mental toll, and it became easier to stop caring after a while.\u000aThankfully, my sister recovered. As any loving parents would, my mom and dad bent over backward to get her the treatment she needed. The transition from high school to college was far less dramatic, and, last summer, my sister graduated from college with distinction. The quirky girl with the rebellious streak has been found again, and I couldn\u2019t be more proud of her.\u000aHowever, after the worst was over, I still had difficulty coping with what I had witnessed. At first, I bottled it all up. Things were getting better, and the sooner I could move on, forget about it, and pretended that it never happened, the better. But the memories lingered vividly, and I had the constant urge to share my experience.\u000aI thought that announcing everything to the world would get this weight off my chest, so I began to tell anyone who would listen: schoolmates, teachers, and random people over the Internet. But that only made the weight heavier. Suddenly, I felt defined by the very thing from which I was trying to escape. At least in my mind, I became that guy with the crazy sister to everyone outside of my family and immediate friend group, and the memories followed me around and suffocated me more than ever. I felt like I had \u201cprostituted\u201d myself á la Holden Caulfield, who warned: \u201cDon\u2019t ever tell anybody anything.\u201d\u000aI struggled with the idea of talking about this period of my life for a long time after that. Could anyone really relate with what I had seen? Did I only want to share my experience for the sake of garnering sympathy and in order to sound tortured? Would I regret making myself vulnerable after the fact?\u000aRecently, I\u2019ve been surrounded by a group of friends who embrace vulnerability. Our M.O. has been to sit back, watch bad movies, and vent with one another about whatever we happen to be going through. Nothing is taboo or off-limits.\u000aBy sharing with me some of the most intimate details of their lives and personal struggles, they\u2019ve slowly peeled away at mine. By creating a safe and trusting environment for me to spill my thoughts \u2013 and then asking penetrating questions about those thoughts \u2013 they\u2019ve teased out details about who I am that were previously foreign to me. They\u2019ve caused me to examine critically the assumptions that I held about myself.\u000aBefore I allowed myself to become vulnerable within a constructive and safe environment, I feel as though, in the words of Elizabeth Bennet, \u201cI never knew myself.\u201d\u000aJust as important, I\u2019ve learned through these discussions that mental health is an issue with which a lot of people can relate. My story is just one of many that go largely unnoticed, and it is not abnormal. Nearly everyone has a story about mental health to tell \u2013 whether it is their personal struggle, or how they\u2019ve coped with their best friend\u2019s or their older sister\u2019s. But in order to talk about it and, in my experience, in order to learn and to heal, first you need to be OK with being vulnerable.\u000aShare this:Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)MoreClick to print (Opens in new window)Click to share on Pinterest (Opens in new window)Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)Click to share on Google+ (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Tags: Bipolar Claremont Colleges Mental Health VulnerabilityCategories: Editorial

aS'Conservative Television Icons'
p1154
aVIf Walter White of AMC\u2019s acclaimed show Breaking Bad were to campaign for mayor of Albuquerque, would he run as a Republican or Democrat? Syndicated columnist Jonah Goldberg has an opinion that might be unsettling for loyal fans. In the Aug.19 issue of the National Review, he asserts that, as someone who makes his own choices, Walter embodies the ideal of personal freedom. Goldberg points, for example, to Walter choosing his own course of cancer treatment against the advice of others. Furthermore, Walter exemplifies a remarkable sense of self-reliance by using his skills as a chemist to pay for his treatments and refusing charity from a former colleague. Freedom of choice is central to conservative thought and serves as the pillar of conservative proposals on issues ranging from healthcare to education reform.\u000aExpanding the scope of Goldberg\u2019s argument, it becomes evident that Breaking Bad is not the only contemporary show with conservative tendencies. It would be easy to label Mad Men a liberal show since it chronicles the social change of the 1960s. However, the show\u2019s main character, Don Draper, is the antithesis of a liberal. Draper ascends from the poverty of the Dust Bowl Midwest to the executive ranks of Sterling Cooper due to his creative prowess and not as a result of any entitlements from the New Deal. During the 1960 election, Draper scolds JFK for his \u201csilver spoon\u201d and for \u201cbuying his way into Harvard,\u201d a stark contrast to his characterization of Nixon as the \u201cAbe Lincoln of California\u201d and \u201cA self-made man from nothing.\u201d A reserved Korean War veteran, he often exhibits contempt for the apathetic laziness of his younger, liberal counterparts.\u000aAt this point one could make the case that the right-leaning Draper is simply meant to serve as a stark contrast to the 1960s political mainstream, with his numerous hardships representing the incompatibility of conservatism with the changing world. However, as the show now prepares for its seventh season, it is evident that Mad Men has routinely shown the darker side of liberalism, with Draper instead representing the nostalgia for the Golden Age. A major theme in season six was the violence and chaos associated with the nationwide protests of 1968, which paved the way for Richard Nixon\u2019s \u201cSilent Majority\u201d speech and subsequent victory. For example, Peggy, Sterling Cooper\u2019s first and only female copywriter, finally concedes to her liberal boyfriend\u2019s demand to live in a more \u201cdiverse\u201d area of Manhattan only to move out months later following routine vandalism and burglaries. Likewise, Betty (Draper\u2019s first wife) is horrified by the vagabond culture she witnesses as she searches for a friend of Sally\u2019s (Sally is Draper\u2019s daughter) in an inner-city crack house. Most important, rather than glorify the anti-war movement, Mad Men essentially mocks the protests against the Vietnam War as misguided and pointless. Don has to use a personal connection to help a neighbor\u2019s young and naïve son avoid being sent to the front lines after mailing in his draft card in protest.\u000aConservatism is also a recurring theme in HBO\u2019s Boardwalk Empire. The show\u2019s protagonist, Nucky Thompson, develops a nationwide bootlegging empire through hard work and self-reliance. As the Republican treasurer of Atlantic City, New Jersey, he uses his entrepreneurial skills to create a booming city filled with vast opportunity. Although the show certainly touches upon the various progressive themes of the 1920s, Boardwalk Empire seems to illustrate the negative consequences of this social change more often than not. Throughout the first season, Jimmy Darmody\u2019s wife has an extensive extramarital affair with a female companion she met while Jimmy was abroad during WWI. Rather than glorify her pursuit of sexual freedom and the overall promiscuity of the flapper generation, the show reflects upon the detrimental impact this relationship has on her husband and young son. Likewise, Nucky\u2019s wife seeks to enlighten the women of Atlantic City regarding contraception, but her effort is portrayed as futile.\u000aThe Sopranos, often heralded as the best show in television history, is perhaps the most conservative of all. The unequivocal protagonist, Tony Soprano, is a socially conservative Catholic, who admits to voting for George W. Bush, and has an obvious disdain for the government. His nephew, Christopher Moltisanti, battles a horrific drug addiction over the course of six seasons, which affects both his professional and personal relationships. This is certainly a far cry from any endorsement of drug legalization (a point Goldberg makes on behalf of Breaking Bad). Perhaps the strongest indicator of conservatism in The Sopranos is the importance the show places upon a traditional family structure. For instance, a key member of Tony\u2019s inner circle, Vito, seeks refuge in New Hampshire once he is discovered to be homosexual. Rather than glorify his new sense of sexual freedom, the show emphasizes the detrimental impact Vito\u2019s absence has on his family.\u000aWhat do the conservative overtones embedded in these popular shows indicate about the current state of society? Given the results of the past couple presidential elections, they certainly do not suggest that the country is becoming more conservative. On the other hand, maybe the United States is still at its core a center-right country, which has been perversely misguided by a liberal media. Perhaps these shows appeal to the inherent conservatism of a majority of Americans. Breaking Bad, Mad Men, Boardwalk Empire, and The Sopranos could very well be the pioneering shows of a conservative revolution directed at television screens across America.\u000aShare this:Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)MoreClick to print (Opens in new window)Click to share on Pinterest (Opens in new window)Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)Click to share on Google+ (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Tags: Boardwalk Empire Breaking Bad Don Draper Mad Men Nucky Thompson The Sopranos Tony Soprano Walter WhiteCategories: Opinion

aS'Defining Libertarianism: A Rebuttal to the \xe2\x80\x9cClaremont Port Side\xe2\x80\x9d'
p1158
aVIn his May 2 article, \u201cAn Ideology at Odds with Itself,\u201d David Leathers of the Claremont Port Side argues that people who claim to be \u201cfiscally conservative and socially liberal\u201d \u2013 namely, Libertarians \u2013 hold an inconsistent set of beliefs. On Leathers\u2019 account, socially liberal causes like free birth control and higher education student loan subsidies cut against the grain of fiscal conservatism and require higher taxes; however, Leathers\u2019 account rests on a misunderstanding of what Libertarians mean when they identify as \u201csocially liberal\u201d and fails to recognize how a fiscal conservative might consistently claim to be socially liberal.\u000aThe traditional distinction between fiscal conservatives and liberals rests on the distinction between negative and positive rights. Where fiscal conservatives typically favor negative rights of non-interference, liberals generally favor a more expanded role of taxation and government in redistributing wealth so as to ensure substantive equality of opportunity. The fiscal conservative stance has its philosophical roots in the libertarianism of Robert Nozick, who famously argues, \u201cTaxation of earnings from labor is on a par with forced labor\u2026taking the earnings of n hours labor is like taking n hours from the person; it is like forcing the person to work n hours for another\u2019s purpose.\u201d On this view, redistributive taxation is unjust because it is tantamount to coercion.\u000aIn an obvious sense, Libertarians would be committed to negative liberties like marijuana legalization, gay marriage, and freedom to choose, but not policies which require taxation, for instance the Affordable Care Act. Yet, as Leathers notes in a recent email interview with the Claremont Independent, \u201cSure, you can be \u2018socially liberal and fiscally conservative\u2019 if you only endorse a narrow swath of negative rights, but in 2013, socially progressive causes encompass much more than just \u2018negative liberties\u2019 like the right of gay couples to marry.\u201d \u000aTo a certain extent, Leathers is right. Even self-styled Libertarians typically recognize the necessity of redistributive initiatives such as the public school system and some level of state-sponsored medical insurance. Fiscal conservatives typically justify their commitment to these sorts of policies with reference to equality of opportunity. However, liberals can just as easily justify a commitment to a more expansive set of redistributive policies by appealing to the same principles. As Leathers explains, his commitment to liberal initiatives like the ACA and government-sponsored higher education is founded in a belief \u201cthat we should elect a government that helps to create equality of opportunity for each citizen.\u201d\u000aWho\u2019s right? Most reasonable people think that a system of total redistribution is unjust. If I work, I ought to be entitled to keep my wages. But yet, as Leathers correctly points out, \u201ca rich person who gets sick is more likely to recover than a poor person without health insurance. This rich person can return to work and support their family. The poor person cannot\u2026the cycle continues.\u201d On both my Libertarian view and Leathers\u2019 liberal perspective, the need for fair equality of opportunity overrides the Nozickian principle that taxes are unjust. \u000aThe question now becomes, \u201cTo what degree does a concern for equality of opportunity dictate a policy of redistributive taxation?\u201d This question is a thorny philosophical problem. Leathers agrees that \u201cit is impossible to tell when there really is \u2018equality of opportunity,\u2019\u201d but suggests that \u201cthis is the direction our country needs to head.\u201d\u000aI disagree. Leathers\u2019 account blurs the distinction between equality of opportunity and substantive equality. Leathers suggests that \u201cgiving each kid a free college education would be a major component\u201d of ensuring equality of opportunity. But this kind of substantive educational equality is conceptually distinct from the kind of equality of opportunity I, as a Libertarian, espouse. A policy of government-funded free college education for every child seems, superficially, to ensure an equal level of economic opportunity to college graduates entering the workforce. But there\u2019s a conflation of terms at play here: the economic opportunity Leathers appeals to is, in fact, a masquerading form of substantive equality of outcome.\u000aEqual opportunity in the Libertarian sense of the term is grounded in exactly the kind of negative rights that delineate Libertarian views from liberal perspectives. A person\u2019s opportunity is equal to another\u2019s if that person is not deliberately coerced in a manner that restricts her capacity to freely act upon her ends. Provided a person is not deliberately excluded, in spite of her merits, from attending college, that person\u2019s opportunity to attend college is exactly equal to any other person\u2019s. \u000aOf course there are exceptions to this rule: Libertarians could defend a publicly funded education system through high school since children aren\u2019t fully developed moral agents and ought not to be held responsible for their parents\u2019 financial situation. Somewhat differently, Libertarians could defend a system of baseline health insurance as a policy that accords with the general will of the people: most people intuitively think that everyone ought to have access to a decent minimum of healthcare even if, like me, they aren\u2019t aware of a compelling moral argument for why this is the case.\u000aBut it is clear Leathers\u2019 argument in favor of equalizing economic opportunity does not fit into this Libertarian conception. Perhaps if everyone attends college the least-well-off will learn enough to earn higher wages and make their lives substantively better. But compressing the range of economic outcomes is only just if one is committed to substantive equality. \u201cSubstantive equality of opportunity\u201d sounds appealing, but isn\u2019t conceptually distinct from \u201csubstantive equality of outcome.\u2019\u201d\u000aLibertarians, conservatives, and liberals alike must reconcile themselves to a hard truth: although human persons are worthy of equal moral concern, with respect to their natural capacity to lead healthy, prosperous lives, human beings are radically unequal. By virtue of the birth lottery some people wind up with high IQs and are born to wealthy families. Economic outcomes are generally much better for Claremont College students than high school dropouts. But what\u2019s the alternative? Liberal guilt over the fact that one is well-off in life is philosophically bankrupt: a commitment to justice only requires a commitment to negative rights of non-interference. Life isn\u2019t fair.\u000aWhere does this leave us? Libertarians are committed to negative liberties like marijuana legalization, gay marriage, and the freedom to choose, which are grounded in the principle of non-interference, but not broadly redistributive policies like the Affordable Care Act. This is the sense in which Libertarians mean they are \u201csocially liberal.\u201d After all, as Leathers points out in his article, the key issue for fiscal conservatives who claim to be socially liberal is gay marriage. Leathers might be right in suggesting that \u201csocial liberalism moved far beyond traditional \u2018negative rights\u2019 a long time ago,\u201d but that merely means that \u201csocially liberal\u201d is a misnomer for Libertarians like myself, not that our ideologies are internally inconsistent.\u000aI would suggest, then, that the real debate David Leathers and I should be having is a philosophical one. Liberals like Leathers are committed to the idea that a respect for human dignity requires more than a commitment not to infringe upon the rights of others, whereas Libertarians like me disagree. It may be the case that we as human beings are morally obliged to minimize the suffering of others through redistributive policies, and so ought to be liberals. But that\u2019s an open question. For now, it suffices to say that it\u2019s perfectly consistent to deny the primacy of that obligation.\u000aShare this:Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)MoreClick to print (Opens in new window)Click to share on Pinterest (Opens in new window)Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)Click to share on Google+ (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Tags: Claremont Port Side David Leathers Libertarian Rebuttal Robert NozickCategories: Opinion Rebuttal

aS'The Problem with Initiation'
p1162
aVAs clubs, teams, and all kinds of other extracurricular organizations at Claremont McKenna College wrap up recruiting season, many have started holding \u201cinitiations\u201d: bonding activities, often centered on welcoming new members and building team camaraderie.\u000aBoth objectives are laudable, but the means to accomplishing these objectives lately have run contrary to the best interest of the CMC community. It goes without saying that hazing and forced drinking are outright wrong and prohibited. And we\u2019d like to believe that the majority of CMC club \u201cinitiations\u201d are in no way hazing merely voluntary, social events that celebrate new members and the year ahead. In fact, with CMC\u2019s vibrant social culture and general enthusiasm for extracurricular activities, we should hope that many clubs would plan bonding events outside of their normal meeting time. My concern is that we\u2019ve lost sight of the true objectives and greater context when we partake in \u201cinitiation.\u201d\u000aThe problem with initiations is that they mimic aspects of hazing even when they are innocuous. For example, club members wearing face paint for club initiations is a nod to hazing behavior and is analogous to activities we commonly condemn \u2013 activities detrimental to CMC culture. Encouraging new members to act or drink in a specific manner at certain times of an event is an acknowledgment, though subtle, of ritual and indoctrination.\u000aWhy is this a problem? Simply put, the fundamentally inclusive environment of CMC that we all value is unintentionally eroded by organization initiations. Initiations run counter to CMC\u2019s pillars of critical, constructive engagement among the student body. At the heart of hazing and initiation activities is the idea that \u201ctrue,\u201d exclusive membership to an organization can only be earned by undergoing them. Under almost no other circumstances would a student succumb to such logic.\u000aAssociated Students of Claremont McKenna College\u2019s (ASCMC) Campus Organization Chair Will Su believes that the majority of initiations are conducted by highly selective campus organizations.\u000a\u201cI would say actually most of the initiations are from our highest per capita [funded] clubs,\u201d Su said. \u201cSo that means the really exclusive and high-funded clubs like Mock Trial, Model UN, those clubs are typically the campus organizations we would hear that there is some type of initiation simply because they go through an extensive application process and I guess there\u2019s some sentiment that they need to be initiated into that small group setting.\u201d\u000aWhat\u2019s more, initiations create problems for leadership. In hopes of creating the best organization possible, leaders look for healthy, positive interaction. Many of the undesirable activities that accompany initiations undercut these purposes. Indoctrination, ritual, and alcohol divide and limit our ability to connect with our new members \u2013 people whom we know very little about. Perhaps these concerns have been muted by overt social pressure, e.g. \u201c#initiation\u201d tags on Facebook newsfeeds, but they are real and deserve reconsideration.\u000aThe reason I\u2019m writing this piece is because I don\u2019t think CMC club and team leaders are consciously preventing an inclusive social culture. I truly believe that most clubs conduct initiations in the spirit of the admirable objectives of team bonding and fun. But I would encourage them to reexamine their initiations and reframe their treatment of new members in a way that doesn\u2019t echo destructive social phenomena \u2013 phenomena that students would reject at face-value.\u000aWriter\u2019s Note: The Claremont Independent requested an interview with Dean of Students Mary Spellman on the issue of club initiation/hazing culture at CMC. Dean Spellman declined to comment on an opinion piece. Dean Spellman also declined to meet off the record with a writer to informally discuss the subject.\u000a[Related: \u201cInitiation in Moderation\u201c]\u000aShare this:Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)MoreClick to print (Opens in new window)Click to share on Pinterest (Opens in new window)Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)Click to share on Google+ (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Tags: ASCMC CMC Hazing InitiationCategories: Campus News Opinion

aVNowadays, everyone in the nation knows about varsity sports and their reported propensity for activities that fall under the banner of \u201chazing.\u201d News stories, movies, and TV shows portray American varsity sport teams as quasi-fraternities, where rookies die from alcohol poisoning and are forced to perform disturbing acts under threat of physical violence. The Claremont Colleges, thankfully, have not seen any such horror story occur in the recent years. This does not mean, though, that many initiation rituals cannot end in emotional, physical, or mental harm. \u000aWith that end in mind, CMS Athletics has taken a very strong stance against any action that could be termed as \u201chazing.\u201d I recently attended a team meeting where Athletics Director Mike Sutton explained the CMS policy regarding initiation and hazing. He explained that any activity, no matter how seemingly mundane or harmless, that singled out one group of athletes from the rest of the team could be defined as hazing. Furthermore, Sutton said that it did not matter if freshmen (or any group/individual) agreed from their own volition to participate in these activities, because they were being, effectively, coerced into participating through strong social pressures. \u000aUnder this framework, any activity that could fit under the definition of initiation is forbidden. Even a simple party where freshman were \u201cwelcomed\u201d to the team and participate in voluntary drinking with the rest of their teammates could be defined as hazing. Under-age drinking rules aside, CMS would argue that the freshmen involved had been coerced into drinking with their teammates (even if they were not \u201ccoerced\u201d into participating in any activity that singled them out as a group). These rules, therefore, place huge limitations on any sort of team-bonding activity, not just initiations. Essentially, the only acceptable alternative of a team-bonding activity would be an activity like watching a movie together (without alcohol, of course). \u000aThis seems to go contrary to CMS\u2019 belief in promoting a strong team culture because it so strongly limits the types of activities they can participate in together. This is not to say athletes can only socialize in an alcohol-fueled setting; it just means that, for example, even if an entire team is going to a registered party together on Saturday, they cannot drink together beforehand. Let\u2019s not kid ourselves that this sort of rule will stop under-age athletes from drinking on their own, or be \u201ccoerced\u201d into drinking with non-athlete friends. What it will result in, though, is the degradation of the team\u2019s spirit, since every athlete will be forced to socialize only with their non-athlete friends every night that they go out. \u000aCMS\u2019 definition of hazing goes above and beyond the actual legal definition of hazing. According to USLegal.com, the legal definition of hazing is \u201can abusive, often humiliating form of initiation into or affiliation with a group.\u201d This includes \u201cany willful action taken or situation created which recklessly or intentionally endangers the mental or physical health of another\u201d or  \u201cany action by any person alone or acting with others in striking, beating, bruising, or maiming\u2026 or attempt to do physical violence to another made for the purpose of committing any of the acts.\u201d The term hazing, however, does not \u201cinclude customary athletic events or similar contests\u2026 and is limited to those actions taken and situations created in connection with initiation into or affiliation with any organization.\u201d This definition is much smaller in scope than CMS\u2019, as it only covers activities that were performed under physical threat, instead of the threat of \u201cnot fitting in.\u201d \u000aIt is curious that CMS has taken such an extreme stance on this issue, especially since the legal definition is so much more limited than their own. While I certainly did not experience any sort of hazing, even under CMS\u2019 definition, as a freshman, I do understand that each team has a different tradition with regards to welcoming their rookies to the group. Therefore, I hope that the increased dialogue and focus on discouraging harmful activities by the Athletic Department prevents any future Stagthena from experiencing any mental, emotional, or physical pain. However, I do not believe that CMS should so harshly shackle the wonderful team spirit that pervades each sport in pursuit of this goal. Consequently, going forward, it would be helpful if CMS reworded their policy to allow athletes to socialize together as friends without fear of punitive action. This would allow athletes to maintain that great CMS spirit while working to prevent hazing from occurring within each team.\u000a[Related: \u201cThe Problem with Initiation\u201c]\u000aShare this:Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)MoreClick to print (Opens in new window)Click to share on Pinterest (Opens in new window)Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)Click to share on Google+ (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Tags: Claremont McKenna CMS Harvey Mudd Hazing Initiation ScrippsCategories: Campus News Opinion

aVWomen\u2019s employment opportunities have certainly increased since the \u201cMad Men\u201d 60s, when a powerful glass ceiling precluded their advancement to leadership in virtually every major American enterprise, both public and private. Now, long removed from the days of Don Draper and Co., women have come a long way: they are equal, if not superior, to men in many sectors of the economy and many fields of knowledge.\u000aWage-wise, women are increasingly dominating the American workplace. According to a recent Forbes article, women control 60 percent of all wealth in the United States, which amounts to roughly $12 trillion. This statistic is only expected to increase, with some analysts having women increasing their control of aggregate wealth to $22 trillion by the year 2020, although this is admittedly a partial function of the demographic demise of male baby boomers.\u000aAlthough women have not consistently arrived at the highest rungs of the economic ladder \u2013 just 15 Fortune 500 companies have women CEOs, and only 73 percent of such companies have female executives of any kind \u2013 those numbers are quickly changing as women continue to dominate the halls of colleges and universities across the nation. Indeed, because more and more graduates of higher education are women, the day is fast approaching when men will be a distinct minority in most board rooms and government agency front offices. For every 100 men, 140 women will graduate with a college degree at some level \u2013 while in 1960, there were 160 men for every 100 women who graduated.\u000aThis presents a problem for those who continue to assert pervasive gender inequality: feminists. Is the decline of one gender in one societal institution (in this case, men in education) something worthy of celebration if it leads to greater gender balance in other areas (more women in corporate leadership positions)?\u000a\u201cMany industries will see a shift in the male-female ratio in the coming decades simply because women are now more likely than men to get a bachelor\u2019s degree,\u201d a recent Scripps Voice column reads. \u201cThis trend extends to graduate programs, where 62.6 percent of Master\u2019s degrees and 53.3 percent of Doctoral degrees are conferred to women according to the National Center for Educational statistics.\u201d\u000a\u201cHopefully over time, this trend in education will transfer to a more gender equitable workplace,\u201d the column concludes.\u000aWhile the author does appear to see this trend as a means for overall gender equality, she also shows very little concern for the growing imbalance among men and women within the ranks of education.\u000aUniversity of Michigan Economics and Finance Professor Mark Perry writes in his American Enterprise Institute blog that if women had been the opposite end of this educational imbalance, it would be deemed a \u201cnational crisis.\u201d\u000a\u201cJust as a thought experiment \u2013 imagine the public reaction if the educational degree imbalances of 4.35 million bachelor\u2019s degrees and 9.7 million college degrees overall favored men, and not women?\u201d Perry said. \u201cI don\u2019t think it would be an exaggeration to say that a college degree imbalance that large in favor of men would be considered a \u2018national crisis.\u2019 College degree disparities, when women are over-represented, never seem to be much of a concern. And with those enormous gender imbalances in higher education favoring women, do we really need hundreds of women\u2019s centers on college campuses all over the country, women\u2019s only study lounges, and female-only campus housing for STEM degrees?\u201d\u000aIt is often said that demography is destiny. As more and more advanced degrees are conferred upon women by the American higher education system \u2013 which remains the central arbiter of life-long income and wealth prospects for most people \u2013 the rise of women into positions of public and private leadership will be exponential, leaving men behind.\u000aFew would disagree that feminism was instrumental in getting rid of the Pete Campbells of the \u201cMad Men\u201d world. But we are now in a very different place. Instead of promoting gender equality, the modern movement now roots for women to do better than men at every turn and celebrates women\u2019s achievements at the expense of male failure. The movement would have more credibility if it would call out gender bias against both men and women and if it would champion the day, paraphrasing Dr.King, when children grow up in an America where they are not judged by their gender but by the content of their character.\u000aShare this:Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)MoreClick to print (Opens in new window)Click to share on Pinterest (Opens in new window)Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)Click to share on Google+ (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Tags: Feminism Higher Education Scripps Scripps VoiceCategories: Opinion

aS'CMC would Benefit from an Independent Forum'
p1174
aVWe at the Claremont Independent take the \u201cindependent\u201d part of our name very seriously. Our publication operates under the principle that, in order to cover the administrations and student organizations of the Claremont Colleges objectively and effectively, complete detachment from those institutions is essential. As a result, the Independent is unique among campus publications in that it purposefully receives zero funding from any of the 5Cs.\u000aIt is because of our commitment to journalistic autonomy that the Independent fully endorses the proposal to separate partially the Forum and CMC\u2019s student government, the Associated Students of Claremont McKenna College (ASCMC), which will be voted on next Monday, Nov. 4, at CMC\u2019s student senate. While the proposal does not completely sever the (particularly financial) ties that bind the Forum to the very student government that it purports to cover, the reform measure marks substantial progress and improvement toward the kind of independent and probing journalism of which we need to see more in Claremont.\u000aThe prospective amendment was announced Sept. 15 at an ASCMC Executive Board meeting by Forum Chief Operating Officer Nathan Falk \u201814, Forum Editor-in-Chief Ana Kakkar \u201914, and ASCMC President Gavin Landgraf \u201914, and is supported by both Forum and ASCMC representatives.\u000aThe reform measure consists of two main points: \u201cThe [Forum] Editor-in-Chief will no longer be an employee of ASCMC\u201d and \u201cThe [Forum] Editor-in-Chief will no longer be chosen by the election committee of ASCMC.\u201d\u000aUnder the current system, the Forum editor-in-chief is placed in an untenable position, fraught with potential conflicts of interest. Most acutely, the editor-in-chief is both charged with determining journalistic content directly related to the practices and policies of ASCMC while also being a paid employee of that very organization.\u000aThe editor-in-chief is similarly hindered by having access to ASCMC\u2019s closed-minute discussions and confidential email dialogues, which effectively inhibits him or her from coordinating content and prompting investigative journalism related to ASCMC.\u000aFinally, the format for selecting the Forum editor-in-chief, via the ASCMC Elections Committee, allows ASCMC to select a candidate beholden to their will.\u000aA more autonomous Forum would provide a crucial check on ASCMC \u2013 an organization that has not exactly been without controversy in recent years. It would help ensure a student government that is more accountable to those it exists to serve \u2013 the students.\u000aWhile this amendment would not grant the Forum complete autonomy \u2013 because, among other things, the publication would still receive funding from ASCMC \u2013 these proposals to improve the independence of the Forum\u2019s editorial leadership are a very positive first step and should be approved by CMC\u2019s senate.\u000aFew had a better take on the matter of an independent, courageous and vigilant press \u2013 and its proximate nexus to human liberty \u2013 than Thomas Jefferson, who famously inspired James Madison to propose the Bill of Rights in 1789, including the guarantee of a free press found in what would become the First Amendment to the United States Constitution. Jefferson offered the following, enduring wisdom: \u201cThe basis of our government being the opinion of the people, the very first object should be to keep that right; and were it left to me to decide whether we should have a government without newspapers, or newspapers without a government, I should not hesitate a moment to prefer the latter.\u201d\u000aEdit: It was initially reported that CMC\u2019s senate would vote on the Forum amendment Oct. 28; however, the date of the vote has been changed to Nov. 4. The article has been updated to reflect this change.\u000aShare this:Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)MoreClick to print (Opens in new window)Click to share on Pinterest (Opens in new window)Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)Click to share on Google+ (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Tags: ASCMC Independence The ForumCategories: Campus News

aS'Claremont College Students Furloughed in Washington'
p1178
aVBy Ambika Bist and Nadeem Farooqi\u000aThe government shutdown surprisingly felt a lot like New Year\u2019s Eve here in the nation\u2019s capital. No, nobody was popping champagne bottles or blowing noisemakers, but there was something exciting about counting down the seconds until the historic moment that the government officially shut down. \u201cShutdown\u2019s Eve,\u201d however, was also a disheartening experience for many, including several fellow Claremont College students on the Washington Program who were not deemed \u201cessential\u201d and are now furloughed.\u000aSierra Gibson CMC \u201915, a furloughed intern at the White House Initiative on American Indian and Alaskan Native Education in the Department of Education, says the shutdown could completely change the focus of her internship.\u000a\u201cI am disgruntled because I was working on a project that was going to help a lot of American Indians in post-secondary education,\u201d Gibson said, \u201cand now, that might be delayed until next year because my agency will be so behind on other projects.\u201d\u000aMany members of the D.C. community who have also been furloughed share Sierra\u2019s irritation. Not surprisingly, discontent with the government shutdown has become the conversation of choice at anything from lunch meetings to networking events; everyone in the area keeps asking each other if they have been deemed \u201cessential\u201d or not. Indeed, when the government shuts down in a government town, many are left without much to contemplate other than when the government will be back open for business.\u000aRichard Ahne CMC \u201915, a furloughed intern at the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights, sees the shutdown as a wasted opportunity.\u000a\u201cIt\u2018s frustrating because preparing for the program is a lot of investment,\u201d Ahne said. \u201cNot just financially, but also in terms of figuring out what you want to do. D.C. is supposed to be very fun, but the primary reason I was here was to intern here, and it\u2019s frustrating to not be able to do that.\u201d\u000aWhile it has been a unique experience to see the ramifications of a government shutdown from an insider\u2019s point of view (and without losing one\u2019s internship), the opportunities for all students to learn as much as they can about the many intricacies of Washington D.C. \u2013 and the American system of government itself \u2013 have been limited as a result. Congress is not holding as many hearings as usual, which reduces their ability to oversee different agencies. The Smithsonian Museum, which includes the National Air and Space Museum, the Natural History Museum, and the National Zoo, is closed \u2013 a very unpleasant reality of the shutdown, as visiting the museum is one of the highlights of coming to D.C. Our very own Washington Program is a bit befuddled, since half of the experience of the Washington Program is having an internship.\u000aWhile it makes for good conversation material that will one day be shamelessly embellished \u2013 \u201cI was actually there when it happened\u201d \u2013 the government shutdown has certainly lost its luster to those of us interning in D.C.\u000aShare this:Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)MoreClick to print (Opens in new window)Click to share on Pinterest (Opens in new window)Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)Click to share on Google+ (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Tags: Claremont Colleges Furlough Government Shutdown Washington ProgramCategories: Campus News

aS'Strunk & White & Twitter'
p1182
aVOne of the most popular professors at the Claremont Colleges has been dead nearly 70 years. No \u2013 he isn\u2019t a ghost or a zombie. Cornell Professor William Strunk, Jr.\u2019s guide on writing, The Elements of Style, has aided countless undergraduates at the Claremont Colleges in refining their writing. The pocket-sized paperback has been in wide distribution since it was edited and expanded by Strunk\u2019s former student, E.B. White (author of Charlotte\u2019s Web), in 1959, and is now in its fourth edition.\u000aWide distribution is not just an expression in the case of Strunk & White, as the pamphlet is commonly known. In its first half-century, it has sold more than 10 million copies. The mention of Strunk & White can provoke cross remarks or high praise. While some rules, like the third rule, \u201cEnclose parenthetic expressions between commas,\u201d are widely agreed upon as fact, others like the seventeenth, \u201cOmit needless words,\u201d which declares that \u201cvigorous writing is concise,\u201d generate fierce debate within literary circles.\u000aOne English Professor writes that Strunk & White\u2019s \u201cadvice ranges from limp platitudes to inconsistent nonsense.\u201d In his eyes, the guide boils down to nothing more than \u201cgrammatical incompetents\u201d and \u201cidiosyncratic bumblers,\u201d among other things.\u000aClaremont McKenna College\u2019s own Strunk & White evangelist, Government Professor John J. Pitney, would not be so unsympathetic. To Professor Pitney, \u201cIt\u2019s a brief, clear book that teaches people how to write briefly and clearly.\u201d Brevity and clarity are commonly accepted as the central tenets of this 85-page work, written for people of all ages, but especially for students.\u000aStrunk & White brings to mind a different sort of device that has trained young people to make every word count: Twitter. We asked Professor Pitney, an avid tweeter himself, for his thoughts on Twitter with relation to Strunk & White. Both Strunk and White died well before the Internet was born, yet they surely would have had their own thoughts on one of its most unique and successful hatchlings.\u000aPutting himself in their shoes, Pitney imagines that \u201cthey\u2019d have mixed feelings. On the good side, it forces users to write concisely. On the bad side, it enables them to publish without thinking. Just look at what happened to Anthony Weiner.\u201d\u000aIn that same vein, Pitney likened Twitter to the printing press. Both \u201cspawned a vast amount of junk,\u201d yet they also offer \u201cmore people more access to good information and writing than ever before.\u201d\u000aWhat most take away from their experience with Strunk & White is that they should refine each sentence down to as few words as possible; however, I would argue that such a mentality, while meritorious in and of itself, serves a second purpose. Paying closer attention to each word and its ability to contribute to a composition helps us  arrive at what needs to be said more quickly, but also more clearly.\u000aWhile a strict adherence to Strunk & White is not ideal for every writer, close attention to one\u2019s word choice is imperative.\u000aThe transition in style from high school to college writing can be a challenging one for new students. Perhaps Strunk & White would not be a bad place to start for freshmen looking to improving their rhetorical prowess.\u000a\u201cOverall, it does more good than harm,\u201d Pitney concluded in his best Strunk & White impersonation.\u000aShare this:Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)MoreClick to print (Opens in new window)Click to share on Pinterest (Opens in new window)Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)Click to share on Google+ (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Tags: Elements of Style Pitney Strunk & White TwitterCategories: Campus News

p1186
aVNothing shows the 5Cs\u2019 true colors like the Claremont Confession Facebook page, where students mired in the collegiate bubble of elite academia pour out their deepest secrets and most profound philosophical reflections.\u000aLet me begin with a confession of my own: I cannot stand Claremont Confession. In fact, I unfriended the thing after a couple months because I was so sick of its dreadfully annoying posts appearing on Facebook every five seconds. But I felt a certain responsibility to warn you fine freshmen about the perils that you\u2019ll soon face every time you check your news feed, so I re-added the account to refresh my memory on the nature of these posts. I guess you could call that sacrificial love.\u000aI\u2019ve compiled below a list of 10 typical posts you can expect to find in Claremont Confession. Friend it at your own risk.\u000a1. Constant rants and links to articles expressing students\u2019 political frustrations\u000aBecause students at the Claremont Colleges really enjoy provoking political \u201cdiscourse\u201d with people who already, for the most part, agree with them.\u000a2. Occasional posts that actually spark legitimate political debates\u000aPeople get pretty heated on Claremont Confession\u2026\u000a3. The privilege confessions\u000aExpect to be told to check your privilege roughly 847,528 times a day.\u000a4. People expressing their sexual woes\u000aI\u2019m really sorry to hear it, but I also don\u2019t want to hear it.\u000a5. Benevolent posts intended to improve your sex life\u000aSome 5C students like to pour out their wisdom on others.\u000a6. Posts about the human body that actually do make you laugh, even if you won\u2019t admit it\u000aLike this one I found: \u201cFarting loudly alone in my room is literally the most satisfying feeling.\u201d\u000a7. Confessions about boobs\u000aScrolling through, I\u2019ve seen several posts from confessors stating that they love their boobs, love touching their boobs, love talking about their boobs, etc. I\u2019ve also seen posts on butts. Big butts, small butts, people who can work their butt, etc.\u000a8. Confessions about human feces\u000aI suppose people just don\u2019t have another outlet to discuss this topic.\u000a9. Confessions that legitimately express extremely sad and tragic events that fellow students have endured.\u000aSuicide, cutting, depression, etc. These ones aren\u2019t easy to read, especially knowing that they were posted by our very own classmates. We may be in the Claremont Bubble, but a lot of us are still really struggling, and if you\u2019re one of those people, you\u2019re not alone.\u000a10. 5C turf wars\u000a\u201cHaters gonna hate?\u201d Screw that! Let\u2019s spew off insults about how much we hate Pomona \u2013 or Pitzer, or Scripps, or Mudd, or CMC. Fortunately, some nonconformist commenters will usually grace such confessions with musings about how the Claremont Colleges should follow in the footsteps of the fine city of Philadelphia and become a \u201cconsortium of brotherly love.\u201d\u000aShare this:Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)MoreClick to print (Opens in new window)Click to share on Pinterest (Opens in new window)Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)Click to share on Google+ (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Tags: Claremont Confessions FacebookCategories: Campus News Humor

aS'Best Places to Study at the 5Cs'
p1190
aVCertain people can study in their dorm rooms and lounges with ease; I\u2019m not one of them. If you\u2019re the sort of person who can grind through Thursday night econ problem sets with Avicii blasting and inebriated classmates traipsing loudly through your dorm, then more power to you. For the rest of us, I\u2019ve compiled a short list of some of my favorite study spots around the 5Cs.\u000aThe Cube: Virtually any CMC student would agree that the Cube easily ranks among the best places to study on campus. Conveniently close to North and Mid-Quad dorms, the Cube has the advantage of being a few minutes closer to home than the library and a very quiet atmosphere. Cons include the general lack of power outlets, the not-so-comfortable mod chairs, and the fact that the almost perfect silence that pervades the place has an eerie quality that will have you glancing around to see who\u2019s breathing so loudly (this last one might just be me, though).\u000aPitzer Mounds: There are a number of good study spots for those who prefer fresh air and sunlight to buckle down and hit the books. For those who don\u2019t mind ambient noise and enjoy a little local color, the Pitzer Mounds are hard to beat. Nab the hammock in the shade under the massive pine trees or you\u2019ll likely be sitting in the grass, though.\u000aScripps Alcoves: This isn\u2019t one particular place, but a reference to the various outdoor nooks and crannies that define the Scripps campus. Whether you favor a shaded table at the basement-level patio west of the Scripps dining hall or the alcove outside the admissions office, you\u2019re sure to find a quiet isolated spot if you look hard enough. Unfortunately the various Scripps alcoves, like the Mounds, are pretty far away, especially in 5C miles.\u000aHub Patio: Not to be conflated with the Hub itself, which is usually loud and guaranteed to be full of people you know, the Hub patio is a fairly good place to study. Centrally located for CMCers, the Hub patio boasts shade provided by umbrellas and quick access to snacks. The main shortcoming of the Hub patio is that friends will probably join you and start up a conversation.\u000aHonnold-Mudd Library: While a fair walk, Honnold is the classic go-to for a place to study. In particular, I\u2019d recommend the always quiet fourth floor or, if you\u2019re looking for a spot with a view, any of the three bridges between the two halves of the library. For those looking for total seclusion, check out the desks interspersed along the stairwell in the stacks. There\u2019s something about the looming presence of thousands of books that is very conducive to concentrating on your studies. The downsides of Honnold include the fact that you often have to scout around to find an open desk and that many of the chairs aren\u2019t especially comfortable.\u000aKravis Research Institutes­: If you are able to land a gig as a research assistant at any of the several research institutes located in the Kravis Center, you\u2019re in luck, because the research institutes win the dubious award of being my favorite place to study at the 5Cs. Brand new ergonomic chairs, great views, complete silence and isolation, and ease of access to Kravis rooftop decks for a stretch are all perks reserved for those whom work for research institutes. Be sure to petition your institute head for 24/7 access to office space. The only con to these exclusive study spaces is that they have a sterile, professional feel to them.\u000aShare this:Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)MoreClick to print (Opens in new window)Click to share on Pinterest (Opens in new window)Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)Click to share on Google+ (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Tags: Honold-Mudd Kravis Pitzer Scripps Study The CubeCategories: Campus News

aS'Surviving 6:01'
p1194
aVBy now, CMC students\u2019 WOA leaders, orientation sponsors, and resident assistants have likely shed some light on \u201c6:01,\u201d the infamous event that concludes the first week of classes and begins CMC\u2019s party year. If your fine mentors went into any detail about 6:01\u2019s rich history, you\u2019ve learned that the occasion previously commemorated the completion of CMC\u2019s dry week.\u000aCMC\u2019s dry week \u2013 during which the school prohibits any and all consumption of alcohol on campus \u2013 previously occupied the totality of freshman orientation and the first week of classes, concluding at 6:00 p.m. on Saturday evening. Naturally, CMC students paid homage to the end of dry week with a cocktail soiree on Green Beach, which began promptly at 6:01 p.m. The 6:01 tradition grew into a state-of-the-art annual festivity as students discovered innovative celebratory techniques, such as pouring champagne into friends\u2019 mouths from over the Green dorm balcony. Unfortunately, that innovation went a little too far a few years ago, when some students endeavored to celebrate the occasion by releasing doves from a cage. (Apparently the release didn\u2019t go as planned.)\u000aThe CMC administration responded to the out-of-handedness that had become 6:01 by shortening dry week to just a few days, concluding at 8:00 a.m. on the morning of the first day of classes. The general understanding is that the college intended to curb the excessive drinking at 6:01 provoked by the long wait. It may have worked \u2013 the party has apparently mellowed the last few years \u2013 but it didn\u2019t stop students from continuing the tradition that is 6:01.\u000aThis year, the college has returned to the previous week-long dry period, with just one catch. Dry week will end at 5:00 p.m. on Saturday rather than 6:00 p.m. There will be a countdown to 6:01 on Green Beach nonetheless.\u000a6:01 can be a fun occasion when celebrated responsibly, but for many it unfortunately becomes a night of regrets. We\u2019d like for you, the class of 2017, to avoid that fate, so we\u2019ve collected a few freshman-year 6:01 anecdotes from some upperclassmen. Do yourselves a favor and learn from our mistakes.\u000a\u201cLike many CMC students, I chose to remain sober throughout high school. While this choice worked well during adolescence, it also meant that I arrived in Claremont ill-equipped to handle 5C parties or Thursday Night Clubs (TNC). At 6:01, I went insane \u2013 to put it mildly. I drank enough rum to satisfy a crew of pirates. When I awoke the following morning in a groggy stupor, I grabbed my towel and headed for the shower. As I was washing shampoo out of my hair, I realized that I had actually entered the girl\u2019s bathroom. Luckily, I managed to escape without alerting the girl in the shower next to me. Enjoy 6:01, but take it easy. You have four years to go wild.\u201d\u000a\u201cAt my freshman year 6:01, I got a little too confident with a guy on Green Beach. I\u2019d seen him around campus during orientation and thought he was cute. When I stumbled into him after the 6:01 countdown, we started talking and he asked if we\u2019d been in the same math department orientation session. (We had.) I immediately blurted out that yes, of course I remembered seeing him there because he was \u2018hard to forget.\u2019 He proceeded to ask me why he was so unforgettable \u2013 upon which I defensively ordered him not to make me answer that question! To this day, I wonder if he remembers this encounter whenever we run into each other on campus. Have fun flirting at 6:01, but don\u2019t forget your filter.\u201d\u000a\u201cI noticed a couple of kids near the fence of one of the Pomona-Pitzer pools talking about how they should hop the fence and go swimming. For some reason, they decided not to, but, being the adventurous drunk that I am, I decided to hop the fence and see what was on the other side. This dangerous venture involved avoiding barbed wire, shimmying across a 15-20 foot tall plaster wall, and sliding down a flag-pole. I somehow made it. Once in the pool area, I didn\u2019t jump in, but decided to open a door to see if I could sneak other people in. When I opened the door, an alarm sounded, so I ran through some bushes, jumped back over the fence as quickly as possible, and was safe \u2013 only to realize that I had just lost my keys, which are worth $150 each, plus a $15 fee for my ID card. With both items necessary for any sort of access to dorms, classrooms and meals, I quickly tried to hop the fence a second time. But, as I reached the top, I saw a security guard in the pool area and immediately decided to abort the mission.\u201d\u000a\u201cBrace yourselves\u2026. College is coming. In times of old (as in last year), there were waterfalls flowing from the hills of Green, streams glistening from the North to Marks, and a glorious, awesome barrage of funk louder than thunder. All dramatics aside, 6:01 is a time of fun, festivities, and free-ranging. Take it from someone who\u2019s been in your shoes: DRINK A LOT\u2026. OF WATER!!! That\u2019s the best way to ensure that you can actually keep up with 6:01 and make it memorable as well. MUCH LOVE AND WELCOME TO THE COMMUNITY!\u201d\u000aShare this:Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)MoreClick to print (Opens in new window)Click to share on Pinterest (Opens in new window)Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)Click to share on Google+ (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Tags: 6:01 Claremont Colleges CMC PartyCategories: Campus News

aS'Four Steps to Avoiding the \xe2\x80\x9cFreshman 15\xe2\x80\x9d'
p1198
aVWelcome, classes of 2017, to the Claremont Colleges. As you are probably already aware, you have entered an extremely exciting period in your lives. This coming year, you will learn to write and speak cogently and evaluate arguments critically. You will also take your first steps in acquiring specialized skills that are valuable in the labor market. Yet, the education you will receive extends beyond just classrooms and lectures.\u000aA single year here in Claremont will relay other lessons, often when you least expect them. For example, the book your professor wrote is always required for class, mom\u2019s cookies are a currency for making friends, and printers malfunction only when your assignment is due in 20 minutes. At times, adjusting to campus life may prove so overwhelming that you turn to food to smother your feelings. How do you know if you are susceptible to emotional eating? There is no set formula, but reflect on these questions: Did you gorge on chocolate after a breakup? Did a traumatic, tearful move-in lead you to seek solace in an entire oven tray of Scripps cookies? Do you plan to hit up the evening food trucks to deal with the stress of juggling academic, social and extracurricular demands? If you answered \u201cyes\u201d to any of these questions, you are in danger of packing on the infamous \u201cFreshman 15.\u201d Fortunately, there are four recommendations you can follow on how to keep the poundage at bay.\u000aFirst: Embrace healthy eating habits. There are few places on campus that exemplify the freedom of a college student more than the 5C dining halls. Nonetheless, rather than cave to your long-suppressed craving for midnight onion rings, try to maintain a healthy eating schedule. Waking up for breakfast is a challenge, especially as the semester progresses. Yet, if you put in the effort, you will be more alert for your morning classes and be less inclined to gorge at the lunch grill. Eating balanced meals is also important (and surprisingly difficult). For example, when searching for fresh fruits you will be hard-pressed to find anything that does not fall into the melon category. Melons are cheap, so we get them up the wazoo. Soon, even the sight of a melon will give you nausea. Luckily, Frary and Scripps dining halls periodically put out morning bananas. If you do manage to arrive before all the bananas are gone, stuff the whole bunch into your bag and dash to the exit lest you experience the wrath of a dining hall employee.\u000aSecond: Watch what you drink. If you make the decision to consume alcohol, keep track of how much you have had. For those of you who are calorie-counters, a can of beer has around 150 calories. A shot of hard liquor averages between 60 and 80 calories and a normal glass of wine comes in at 120. Alcohol is a wellspring of hidden calories that will quickly settle on your waistline. Trust me, a semester\u2019s worth of excessive partying will see you investing in a new wardrobe to accommodate the new you.\u000aThird: Stay active. The 5Cs offer a plethora of athletic outlets. If you are not already on a sports team, join one of the intramural teams; take a break from studying and participate in hallway Nerf wars; get a group together and trek up Mount Baldy; embrace the beefcake lifestyle by spending a couple of hours in the weight room; sign up for a PE class that actually requires physical exertion; use the stairs. (You get the point.)\u000aFinally: Try to get to sleep at a reasonable hour. There will be nights when you are frantically composing an essay due the following day, but don\u2019t make this a habit. Snacks inevitably find their way into your mouth late at night. Strive to avoid the 2:00 a.m. In-N-Out run. Forewarning: Students enjoy bragging about their sleep deprivation. Dinner conversations usually include some version of, \u201cOh yeah? Well I haven\u2019t slept in three days!\u201d If you fight the urge to join in the competition, you will look and feel better.\u000aFreshman year tends to be a rollercoaster of highs and lows. Dining halls and parties are certainly part of the first year experience. Occasionally splurging on chocolate fondue or raging at Foam Party is a great way to celebrate your self-discipline, as long as you return to healthy habits. By being mindful of your choices in the buffet line, and elsewhere around campus, you can turn the \u201cFreshman 15\u201d into an urban legend.\u000aShare this:Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)MoreClick to print (Opens in new window)Click to share on Pinterest (Opens in new window)Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)Click to share on Google+ (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Tags: Food Freshman 15 HealthyCategories: Campus News

aS'\xe2\x80\x9cWhat looks good?\xe2\x80\x9d: Dining Halls at the Claremont Colleges'
p1202
aVUnlike students at other colleges and universities, 5Cers are spoiled with choices when deciding where to eat. While it might be daunting at first, the varied selection of dining halls ends up becoming one of the best perks of attending the Claremont Colleges. That being said, each dining hall has its own pros and cons with regards to food quality, location and atmosphere. So, before you use up that precious meal-swipe (which you can only use once each meal), here is a cursory review of each dining hall to aid you in your decision of where to eat.\u000aPomona College\u000aFrank: Located in the south campus of Pomona (near the Pomona freshman dorms), a trip to Frank is quite the trek for most 5C students. That\u2019s not to say that non-Pomona freshmen should ignore it completely, as it is the only dining hall that offers cuisine that is not typically found across the 5Cs (such as soul food-themed meals). Pomona freshmen will be eating at Frank most days whether they like it or not because Pomona\u2019s south campus is so far from the other dining halls.\u000aFrary: Located in the northeast corner of Pomona, Frary is known by many students as the \u201cHogwarts\u201d dining hall. Its high-vaulted ceilings, dark wooden furniture and huge mural of Prometheus certainly set the scene and create a dining experience that is truly one of a kind. The food is pretty standard 5C fare, with some gems thrown in every once in a while. Recently, Frary has begun offering fresh, oven baked cookies that give Scripps a run for its money (sacrilege, I know) and its \u201cburrito and quesadilla night\u201d is probably the best Tex-Mex you will find on campus (just don\u2019t expect Chipotle-quality burritos).\u000aOldenborg: The least popular dining hall \u2013 for good reason. Even though the food at the Claremont Colleges is generally at a high level (especially compared to cafeterias in other universities/high schools), Oldenborg\u2019s food quality falls way below the norm. The unique thing about Oldenborg is that it only offers lunch, and you have to sit at foreign language tables where people converse in languages other than English (speaking English is definitely frowned upon). Pomona foreign language classes typically force you to eat there during the semester as a way to practice speaking in another language. Oldenborg is one dining hall to stay away from \u2013 unless you need to go there for a class.\u000aClaremont McKenna College\u000aCollins: Offering what can be best described as the most consistent food available to students, there typically isn\u2019t anything mind-blowingly good at CMC\u2019s Collins Dining Hall, but there is always something that you will enjoy. Collins is best known for its lunch offerings, such as \u201cWorld Wok\u201d and \u201cLittle Italy.\u201d If you get there before (or after) the lunch rush, I definitely recommend getting these made-to-order offerings. The highlight of the year is far and away the famous Christmas dinner, with a live band and some of the best food you will get in the 5C dining halls. Unfortunately though, for other Claremont Colleges students, this is a CMC-only event.\u000aScripps College\u000aMalott: Scripps\u2019 Malott Dining Hall is known primarily for its lunches. If you enjoy fresh, make-your-own salads, you can\u2019t go wrong by eating at Scripps. Students who are used to meals with fewer greens should stay away, but, for those who like a healthy lunch, this is the best place to eat. Dinners are usually on the disappointing side, especially if you like your dinners to be filling. That being said, Scripps offers the best weekly steak dinner at the 5Cs, and its fresh, oven-baked cookies are almost a reason to go to Scripps\u2019 dinners alone. Scripps\u2019 made-to-order brunch smoothies are also one of the most popular drinks offered across the dining halls \u2013 just beware of the lines.\u000aPitzer College\u000aMcConnell: If you wake up for it, Pitzer\u2019s breakfast is by far the best in the Claremont Colleges. Offering fresh-squeezed juices, smoothies, and the best omelets and pastries you will find on campus, Pitzer breakfast makes waking up for those weekday morning classes manageable. It also is the only campus to offer a weekly \u201cAM in the PM\u201d dinner, which is a highlight for those who like eating omelets and pancakes in the evening. Desserts are also delicious, with a wide variety of fresh treats available at every meal.\u000aHarvey Mudd College\u000aHoch-Shanahan: Last, but certainly not least, is Harvey Mudd\u2019s Hoch-Shanahan Dining Hall. Whether its breakfast, lunch, dinner or brunch, you will generally be glad that you made the (long) walk to \u201cThe Hoch,\u201d as it\u2019s affectionately known on campus. Pasta night is extremely popular, but you will have to wait in line for sometimes up to 30 minutes to get your food. Friday night make-your-own pizza is a highlight, too, offering the only made-to-order, individual-sized pizzas at the 5Cs. If you have the time to walk there, you will (usually) not be disappointed.\u000aOne last tip: Bookmark Mike Maltese\u2019s 5C Menu web app (http://aspc.pomona.edu/menu/). Updated daily with the latest menus, it allows you to compare dining hall menus on one, simple page. It is absolutely invaluable when deciding where to eat at the 5Cs.\u000aShare this:Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)MoreClick to print (Opens in new window)Click to share on Pinterest (Opens in new window)Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)Click to share on Google+ (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Tags: Claremont Colleges Dining HallsCategories: Campus News

aS'I Think Therefore I Am\xe2\x80\xa6Awesome: A Review of CMC\xe2\x80\x99s Philosophy Department'
p1206
aVDo you ever wonder how health care should be distributed? Do you want to know if the government is even justified in providing social services such as health care? Do you think that taxes are unjust? Do you want to figure out what justice entails? Do you want to know if there\u2019s more to the world than just studying and working? Do you ever wonder if God exists? Do you want to explore the very concept of God or of the world\u2019s existence?\u000aIf you\u2019ve answered \u201cyes\u201d to any of the above questions, then you want to take a course offered by CMC\u2019s philosophy department.\u000aBut is it really worth it? Isn\u2019t philosophy supposed to be boring? Well, from a philosopher\u2019s standpoint, obviously not. But even if you\u2019ve found philosophy boring in the past, CMC\u2019s philosophy department is different. Here are some reasons why you should take philosophy classes, even if you are not a philosophy major.\u000aSubject Material: CMC\u2019s philosophy department offers a very broad range of courses. To provide some examples, the department offers courses including: the philosophy of religion, for all of you theists and atheists, as well as those somewhere in between; the philosophy of science fiction, for all of you fans of \u201cMemento\u201d and \u201cThe Matrix\u201d; metaphysics, for those worried about the concept of free will and the universe\u2019s beginning; epistemology, for everyone who thinks that we can\u2019t really know anything\u2026 at all; ancient philosophy, for everyone who wants to put Aristotle-wannabes to shame; political philosophy, for all political junkies who love debating; the philosophy of health economics, for everyone interested in gaining a broader understanding of the industry; and the philosophy of law, for all of you aspiring lawyers. This is list is not exhaustive, but is meant show that you have A LOT of options to choose from.\u000aClass Size & Discussion: As you may already know, we have small classes, and that is extremely beneficial in philosophy classes. Small class sizes offer you the opportunity to not only engage the subject material with the professor, but also to discuss amongst your peers. The small class sizes also mean that non-majors can find the courses interesting; you are able to discuss your own opinions in the class, and the emphasis on discussion makes the classes interesting. Some of the most enlightening classes I\u2019ve had while at CMC have been amazing because I was able to have heated discussion with my classmates. Your perspective widens immensely when exposed to the opinions of others who are actively engaged in the classroom. And since CMC-ers are known for being fairly smart and outgoing, your classes will be filled with intense discussion.\u000aAwesome Professors & Accessibility: The philosophy professors not only have a great deal of academic qualifications, they have great personalities that make their classes interesting and accessible. I\u2019ve often found myself in the halls of the philosophy department in Kravis just to discuss some ideas with professors whose classes I was not even taking. They genuinely care about students\u2019 understanding and perspectives, and put in the extra effort to ensure that each student finds the subject interesting and enlightening. When I\u2019m in a philosophy class, there is a copious amount of humor, a lot of mind-blowing moments, and overall a sense that everyone is enjoying the class \u2013 all of which of would be nearly impossible without epic professors. In fact, the small class atmosphere provides the professor with the opportunity to get to know you. With this benefit, if you ever have questions, you don\u2019t just need to rely on office hours, you can just go to lunch with your professor to discuss your ideas.\u000aPhilosophy Events: The department\u2019s engagement is not just limited to the classroom. The department will often host guest lecturers to give talks outside of the class and the Athenaeum on such subjects as the philosophy of mathematics and the idea of will power. Furthermore, the department will host non-academic events. For example, Professor Locke takes his students on a paintball excursion at the end of the year to finish off the second semester in a fun way. Additionally, the department throws parties, as was done last semester at Professor Kreines\u2019s house, where he hosted a taco party with the philosophy professors and special guest President Chodosh.\u000aConclusion: Philosophy is a big subject, and CMC offers a range of courses to help you grasp the complexity of the discipline. What I\u2019ve realized, however, is that although I\u2019ve learned a lot from my philosophy courses, what has truly made my experience with CMC philosophy memorable is the professor-class dynamic. I did not just study for the sake of doing well in the class; I studied and pushed myself because my professor and peers made me genuinely interested in the material and in improving my knowledge.\u000aAnd that\u2019s why I highly recommend taking some philosophy courses during your time at CMC. But don\u2019t just take my word for it; ask around. You\u2019ll find that there\u2019s a consensus that CMC philosophy courses aren\u2019t just good \u2013 they\u2019re awesome.\u000aShare this:Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)MoreClick to print (Opens in new window)Click to share on Pinterest (Opens in new window)Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)Click to share on Google+ (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Tags: CMC PhilosophyCategories: Campus News

aS'Thursday Night Club Controversies: What to Expect'
p1210
aVThe social scene at Claremont McKenna is a tradition that is oft referenced as something that sets the school apart. Part of this tradition is Thursday Night Club or TNC. This Thursday night party has had its high points and low points, but it remains a very visible part of the social scene. However, a new tradition has recently emerged in conjunction with TNC: The theme for the party inevitably provokes outrage and accusations of insensitivity, largely from the other 4Cs.\u000aLast year, the consortium experienced two separate incidents surrounding proposed TNC themes.  The two theme proposals that provoked a negative response did so for such disparate reasons that it seems likely a similar incident will occur again this year.\u000aThe first was provoked by a survey in which students got to come up with suggestions for the party and then vote for their favorite theme. One of the entries was a Thanksgiving-themed suggestion entitled \u201cThanksgiving: Bros, Pilgrims and Navajos,\u201d which utilized the common TNC rhyming scheme of \u201cBros and Hoes.\u201d While the suggestion was eventually passed over in favor of another name, the Pomona-centric student newspaper, the Student Life, reported that the theme drew complaints and allegations of racism. The complaints charged that the theme was historically and culturally insensitive and that CMC in general lacked proper education in cultural sensitivity. Such sweeping generalizations overlooked the context of the theme suggestion and weakened valid arguments against it. The theme could be perceived as derogatory, but the complaints failed to recognize the traditionally light-hearted nature of TNC themes and the highly educated and aware audience at which it was aimed.  The controversy quickly devolved into interschool arguing and very little was resolved.\u000aThe second controversy came later in the year, when a theme entitled \u201cCamo & Ammo\u201d drew protests that the theme was insensitive given the then recent Newtown shooting. In response, CMC\u2019s student government, the Associated Students of CMC (ASCMC), changed the title to \u201cCamo TNC,\u201d and then \u201cZero Dark 30\u2019s.\u201d While some may not agree with the outrage over the earlier theme, the motivation behind it was at least understandable. The complaints about the second theme, however, appeared to be only tangentially related to the underlying issue and a manifestation of politically correct hypersensitivity. The theme was supposed to promote a camouflage- and military-themed party, and it is difficult to see how that directly relates to a civilian shooting. Censoring all things firearms-related in our culture would mean cutting out large swathes of our cultural product and accomplish little in the interim. This controversy appears almost opportunistic \u2013 an opportunity to complain about an event without any real justification. The difference between this complaint and the one from earlier in the year indicates that such a controversy will happen again this year.\u000aSuch controversies will happen again because the gap between the general student body, who care only briefly about the theme to begin with and forget it soon after the party ends (or even before that point), and the activists, who make increasingly ominous proclamations that the theme of a Thursday night party contributes to broader ongoing societal disorder, is quite broad. For some of the themes, greater sensitivity would avoid needless division, but for others, reflection and a better perspective would forestall protests of every single idea that isn\u2019t bland and whitewashed.\u000aThe end lesson of all this is, quite simply, that you cannot make everyone happy all of the time. The people who plan TNC are charged with coming up with creative and entertaining ideas so the parties remain fresh and attended. These ideas, meant for a specific audience, may not always mesh perfectly with the ideals of every single student at the 5C\u2019s, and some may annoy or even offend people on campus. It happens. What is important to remember is that these events are meant to allow students a chance to unwind and have some fun. If a theme significantly impedes that goal, speak out. People have different perspectives and, coupled with time constraints, may fail to consider all the implications and impact of their ideas. However, as no one should expect to be vindicated all the time, when raising issues with the themes, let\u2019s restrict complaints to substantive arguments that move the debate forward, not accusations that stop conversation.\u000aShare this:Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)MoreClick to print (Opens in new window)Click to share on Pinterest (Opens in new window)Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)Click to share on Google+ (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Tags: ASCMC CMC Controversies TNCCategories: Campus News Opinion

aS'Class Reviews: Seven Classes to Take Before Graduating'
p1214
aVTrying to figure out which classes to take upon first entering college can be a daunting task. Fulfilling GE requirements (for those of you who have them) while still taking genuinely interesting classes is no small feat. Therefore, we at the Claremont Independent have gone around and asked students from across the 5Cs which class they would most highly recommend incoming students take during their time here. In the end, we came up with a diverse list that will hopefully help you navigate through the seemingly infinite amount of classes available at the Claremont Colleges.\u000aPolitical Philosophy\u000aWhile CMC is mainly known for its Economics and Government Departments (and rightly so), the CMC Philosophy Department is a hidden gem that every Claremont College student should discover, regardless of major. Even though the Philosophy GE might seem like a chore at first for CMC non-philosophy majors, you\u2019d be surprised with how fascinating these classes can be. As an Econ-Gov dual major, I chose to take Political Philosophy for my philosophy GE, hoping to fulfill my GE with the least pain possible. A few weeks in, and Political Philosophy had become one of my favorite classes at CMC. Although the class was three times a week (including a class on the worst of class days, Friday), it was a joy going to each and every class because I always knew the discussions would be thoroughly enjoyable (not to mention enlightening). By the end of the semester, Professor Schroeder had made a class full of Econ and Gov majors (like myself) appreciate philosophy in a way we would never have expected. My personal highlight was Schroeder\u2019s lectures on Kant, as he made a nearly indecipherable text comprehensible and engaging. There aren\u2019t many classes that I can genuinely say changed the way I think about the world, but Political Philosophy with Professor Schroeder definitely did.\u000aBehavioral Economics\u000aBehavioral Econ at Scripps with Professor Sean Flynn is a once a week seminar you don\u2019t want to miss out on. Professor Flynn (author of Economics for Dummies and the number one seeking Econ text book) is really engaging and encouraging. Students are encouraged to tell personal stories in class, and then he proceeds to analyze and relate them back to behavioral economics. There is often a sizable amount of reading, but you have a week to do it \u2014 and though it\u2019s dense, it\u2019s also interesting. Behavioral Econ is a great mix of 5C students and really allows you to think about economics in a completely new way.\u000aBasic Principles of Chemistry\u000aThe science requirement: It hangs over the heads of so many whom major in the humanities or social sciences for far too long. Consider eliminating it before it causes trouble. Consider chemistry. Give yourself more flexibility in future semesters, exposure to a different way of looking at the world, and, just maybe, second thoughts about your anticipated major. Chemistry is great not because it\u2019s easy, but because it\u2019s a challenge. It does not rival Organic Chemistry in difficulty, but chances are that it will demand more of you than the average government course. After three 9:00 a.m. classes and one four-hour lab per week, you\u2019ll end up knowing much more about the world around you at its basic level, and you\u2019ll leave with more respect for those whom do choose a major in the sciences, and with it, several such courses each semester.\u000aCalifornia Politics\u000aAnd you thought field trips were a thing of the past! In CMC Professor Ken Miller\u2019s California Politics, students not only read about and discuss California\u2019s government, history, and current political issues, but they also see them first-hand. The class has a long tradition of visiting Sacramento for a couple days of meetings with politicians, journalists, and lobbyists \u2013 the people who make Sacramento move (well, at least the Democrats among those) \u2013 so students gain experiences that even the Kravis Center cannot provide. California Politics is about more than just a state\u2019s politics, it\u2019s about the struggle of the largest state in the Union to reconcile its dreams with the realities of the 21st Century. Oh, and you\u2019ll leave with plenty of stories about Governor Jerry Brown, the state\u2019s oldest and youngest governor, under your belt.\u000aBallroom Dancing\u000aOne of my favorite classes taken so far is Ballroom Dancing at Pomona with Mr. Paul Roach. Knowing how to dance socially is very useful in life after college for weddings, formal events, etc. and is a sure way to impress friends, family, and even employers. Not only does this class fulfill one of your PE requirements, but you will have lots of fun doing it and meet and dance with some really talented students across the 5Cs.\u000aIntro. to Computer Science\u000aWant to learn to code? Introduction to Computer Science (CS5) with Prof. Dodds is the quintessential Harvey Mudd experience. Taken by Mudders and off-campus students alike, CS5 is accessible no matter your past technical experience. The class is a great blend of hands-on labs and theoretical concepts, teaching programming skills sure to be useful in a wide variety of professions.\u000aIntro. to Accounting\u000aAs a freshman, I reviled the idea of accounting: mindless, awful number-crunching. Still, against my better judgment, I took Professor Massoud\u2019s Intro. to Accounting (Econ 86) at my parents\u2019 behest and was shocked to find myself loving it. As Professor Massoud says, accounting is the \u201clanguage of business,\u201d and whether or not you plan to become an accountant, as I have, it\u2019s pretty likely you\u2019ll be involved in the world of business. Professor Massoud\u2019s class offers insight and clarity into that world, and I guarantee he\u2019ll make it interesting. Just take it, you\u2019ll love it!\u000aShare this:Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)MoreClick to print (Opens in new window)Click to share on Pinterest (Opens in new window)Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)Click to share on Google+ (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Tags: Claremont McKenna Class Reviews Harvey Mudd Pitzer Pomona ScrippsCategories: Campus News

p1218
aVClasses of 2017,\u000aCongratulations! On behalf of the Claremont Independent, a leader in conservative and libertarian thought on campus, I would like to welcome you to the Claremont Colleges. Whether you will be making Claremont McKenna, Harvey Mudd, Pitzer, Pomona or Scripps your home for the next four years, you\u2019ve chosen a wonderful institution of higher learning and have become part of an intercollegiate community unlike any other.\u000aOne of the most memorable experiences leading up to my enrollment at CMC was the roommate selection process, with which I\u2019m sure you are all intimately familiar by now. I remember refreshing my student email account dozens of times daily in search of the much-anticipated announcement of whom I would be rooming with for the next nine months.\u000aWhen I finally received the name, I did the only reasonable thing possible and immediately found my soon-to-be roommate on Facebook. But before I even had the chance to find out which books he had read, what movies he liked, or who he was in general (as much as one can glean from Facebook), I was dismayed to see the profile picture of some ginger with glasses holding a poster that read: \u201cObamacare: Saves $, Saves Lives.\u201d\u000aA ginger, I can deal with \u2013 but a Democrat? That was too much. I showed my staunchly conservative father the photo, and he was aghast. \u201cI thought CMC was supposed to be the conservative school,\u201d he remarked. Questions of my impending indoctrination immediately followed. Would I end up like my older sister \u2013 the sociology major \u2013 who left Right and came back home Left?\u000aWhen I finally got to campus and met my roommate, we got the pleasantries and formalities out of the way and went straight for the jugular: Are you an elephant or a donkey? Naturally, he said he was a big-government Democrat (he would go on to manage the Obama reelection campaign on campus), and I confirmed that I was a small-government conservative with strong libertarian overtones. The tension in the air was thick. After a long pause, he finally responded, \u201cCool. I respect that.\u201d\u000aOver the course of the school year, we challenged each other\u2019s political beliefs on a seemingly nightly basis. We debated and discussed everything related to politics imaginable: Obamacare, abortion, gay marriage, free markets, regulation, sustainable energy, federalism, education reform, church vs. state, illegal immigration, marijuana legalization, Moon colonies, the one percent, the 47 percent, Paul Ryan\u2019s deep blue eyes, and, most contentiously, to which political party each incarnation of Batman would have belonged and which would have made the most suitable president.\u000aNot only did I learn more about Batman than I ever planned or hoped to, but I also made tremendous strides as a political thinker through these discussions. Neither of us was particularly successful in changing the other\u2019s mind, but I think we both acquired a newfound respect for our political rivals on the other end of the spectrum and became great friends in the process. (The story is currently being made into a Disney Channel original movie.)\u000aIn case you haven\u2019t already noticed, we are a very politically charged consortium of colleges. Although you just missed election season, emotions still run high on all things politics, and we don\u2019t always do the best job of respecting our counterparts on the other side of the aisle.\u000aI encourage you to embrace the political culture on campus.

aS'Scripps, CMC Faculty Exchange Blows on Raviv Incident'
p1222
aVThe Scripps College faculty made a thinly veiled criticism of Claremont McKenna College Associate Professor of Economics Yaron Raviv and the CMC administration in a May 9 statement, prompting a dismissive reply by the CMC faculty obtained by the Claremont Independent.\u000aThe Scripps faculty statement referred to the March 4 incident at CMC\u2019s Collins Dining Hall between Professor Raviv and a member of the Students for Justice in Palestine (SJP), who attends Pitzer College, during an SJP protest in which they simulated an Israeli checkpoint.\u000a\u201cThe Scripps College faculty wishes to reach out to the 5 C students, and in particular to Scripps students, and assert that the Scripps faculty takes the incident of March 4 on CMC Campus very seriously, especially in regard to the alleged verbal abuse of a student by a faculty member,\u201d the statement begins.\u000aAlthough the Scripps faculty statement never mentions Professor Raviv by name, several of the comments are clearly directed at him and seem to implicate his guilt in making a supposedly racial slur, \u201ccockroach,\u201d to the SJP member.\u000a\u201cIf such an incident had occurred on the Scripps campus or involved a Scripps professor, Scripps College would undertake an investigation into the incident,\u201d the statement continues, \u201cand if it were determined that verbal abuse, hate speech, and/or racialized epithets had occurred, would take appropriate action.\u201d\u000a\u201cWe uphold the rights of all community members to organize, protest and express dissent without being subjected to racism and verbal abuse. We abhor the use of racialized epithets that undermine the principles of community, diversity and inclusivity that we, as a faculty, affirm.\u201d\u000aThe CMC faculty released a statement in response to the Scripps faculty statement on June 18.\u000a\u201cWe [members] of the CMC faculty write concerning your \u2018Statement in response to the March 4 Incident on CMC Campus,\u2019\u201d the statement begins.  \u201c\u2026We are deeply troubled by this statement and what it implies.\u201d\u000aThe CMC faculty statement notes that the Scripps faculty failed to cite the CMC investigation into the March 4 incident, only citing the investigation conducted by Pitzer. The separate investigations appear to contradict each other, with the former finding, \u201cWhen impeding access to the main entrance of Collins Dining Hall, the SJP event was not in compliance with CMC\u2019s Demonstration\u2019s Policy and The Claremont Colleges Demonstrations Policy,\u201d and the latter apparently finding the performance in compliance with the demonstrations policy, although it has not yet been released to the public.\u000aA picture of the event (link below) clearly shows SJP members blocking the entrance to Collins Dining Hall as a part of their performance.\u000aThe CMC faculty statement also points out that although the CMC investigation found Professor Raviv\u2019s actions \u201cinappropriate and unprofessional, they were not severe or pervasive as to constitute a violation of the College\u2019s Harassment Policy.\u201d\u000a\u201cYet these actions were simply ignored by the Scripps faculty,\u201d the statement continues, \u201cas if CMC had done nothing in response to the March incident.\u201d\u000aProfessor Raviv, an Israel native, refuted the allegation that he used a racial slur in an April 22 interview with the Claremont Independent, saying, \u201cFirst of all, Israelis do not use that kind of expression with respect to Palestinians\u2014that\u2019s a total lie. But I don\u2019t need to use this argument because there was no way that me, or any other person, could tell that the person in front of me was Palestinian. How could I know that he was a Palestinian? His English was much better than mine; he grew up here in the states.\u201d\u000aThe CMC faculty statement was signed by 46 members of the CMC faculty.\u000aA representative from the Scripps faculty could not be reached for comment before press time.\u000aTranscripts of the respective faculty statements are included below.\u000a \u000a \u000aScripps faculty statement:\u000aStatement in response to the March 4 Incident on CMC Campus\u000aThe Scripps College Faculty wishes to reach out to 5 C students, and in particular to Scripps students, and assert that the Scripps faculty takes the incident of March 4 on CMC Campus very seriously, especially in regard to the alleged verbal abuse of a student by a faculty member.\u000aThe Pitzer College investigation into the matter has shown that the 4-college students involved in the SJP event of March 4th did not violate any procedures in carrying out their event. It is CMC, however, that has the responsibility for further investigation into the professor\u2019s behavior, and conducting that investigation is not within Scripps College\u2019s purview. If such an incident had occurred on the Scripps campus or involved a Scripps professor, Scripps College would undertake an investigation into the incident, and if it were determined that verbal abuse, hate speech, and/or racialized epithets had occurred, would take appropriate action.\u000aWe wish to affirm that academic freedom, exposure to multiple perspectives, and engagement in debate and dialogue are central to the mission of colleges and universities as centers for learning and independent thought. We uphold the rights of all community members to organize, protest, and express dissent without being subjected to racism and verbal abuse. We abhor the use of racialized epithets that undermine principles of community, diversity, and inclusivity that we, as a faculty, affirm.\u000aBecause of the controversy surrounding the handling of this event, we ask that the Intercollegiate Faculty Council evaluate the Intercollegiate Demonstrations Policy and make recommendations regarding its revision to the Presidents Council, so that the policy can be fairly and objectively applied in the future.\u000a \u000a \u000aCMC faculty statement:\u000aJune 18, 2013\u000aDear Scripps Faculty,\u000aWe [members] of the CMC faculty write concerning your \u201cStatement in response to the March 4 Incident on CMC Campus,\u201d which, apparently, passed the Scripps faculty on Thursday, May 9. (We have no information on the actual vote.)\u000aWe are deeply troubled by this statement and what it implies. We particularly call your attention to the second paragraph of your statement:\u000a\u201cThe Pitzer College investigation into the matter has shown that the 4-college students involved in the SJP event of March 4th did not violate any procedures in carrying out their event. It is CMC, however, that has the responsibility for further investigation into the professor\u2019s behavior, and conducting that investigation is not within Scripps College\u2019s purview. If such an incident had taken place on the Scripps campus or involved a Scripps professor, Scripps College would undertake an investigation into the incident, and if it were determined that verbal abuse, hate speech, and/or racialized epithets had occurred, would take appropriate action.\u201d\u000aWhat is so odd about this account is that it references the Pitzer College investigation, takes it as authoritative, and makes no reference at all to CMC\u2019s own investigation and the disciplinary actions already taken by CMC. By noting CMC\u2019s \u201cresponsibility for further investigation into the professor\u2019s behavior,\u201d the statement implies that CMC had not completed its investigation, or perhaps had not even done one. Yet, as the Scripps faculty knew on May 9, CMC President Pamela Gann had twice communicated the results of CMC\u2019s investigation and administrative action to the Claremont Colleges community (April 19 and May 7), and in the first of those communications attached the actual report of the CMC Dean of Students. It is our understanding that these communications were forwarded to all Scripps faculty when they were originally sent from President Gann\u2019s office and, moreover, that these materials were made available to the Scripps faculty through Sakai prior to the May 9 faculty meeting. Although CMC made its own report available to the Claremont Colleges community, we have seen no corresponding formal report on the march 4 incident from Pitzer College, and thus are in no position to conclude that the Pitzer College investigation \u201chas shown that the 4-college students involved in the SJP event of March 4th did not violate any procedures in carrying out their event.\u000aAccording to the April 19, 2013, report by the Dean of Students of Claremont McKenna College:\u000a\u201cThe [CMC] review included information provided through interviews with 11 witnesses, including the Pitzer student and CMC faculty member involved in the incident. Additional witnesses included two other SJP students, who observed the interaction with the faculty member, the Campus Safety Officer, as well as other students and staff members who were present. I also reviewed relevant documents, including the event registration form, email communications about the event, and the Campus Safety incident report.\u201d\u000aAmong the key factual findings of the CMC investigation are the following:\u000a\u201cThe SJP [Students for Justice in Palestine] event at Collins Dining Hall involved a \u201cstreet theatre\u201d performance that simulated Israeli identification checkpoints. The SJP organized itself so that anyone seeking to access the main entrance to Collins Dining Hall had to pass through the simulated checkpoint, including being asked to present identification to the actors. . . .\u000aThe event participants complied with requests to adjust their event so as to not restrict access for a period of time, but at a certain point reorganized themselves in a manner that again restricted access.\u201d\u000aWe note that to block access to a campus building is a violation of the \u201cPolicy on Demonstrations at the Claremont Colleges\u201d of August 28, 2001, which prohibits \u201cdisruptive actions or demonstrations . . . that restrict free movement on any of the campuses, or interfere with, or impeded access to, regular activities or facilities of any of the Colleges or CCU.\u201d In the words of the CMC report:\u000a\u201cWhen impeding access to the main entrance of Collins Dining Hall, the SJP event was not in compliance with CMC\u2019s Demonstrations Policy and the Claremont College\u2019s Demonstration Policy, both of which prohibit disruptive and/or non-peaceful events, including \u2018actions in which there is a deliberative disruption or an impedance of access to regular activities of the College or of the College community, including those which restrict free movement on the campus.\u201d\u000aYet the Scripps faculty concluded that \u201cthe SJP event of March 4th did not violate any procedures in carrying out their event.\u201d On what grounds do the Scripps faculty reject the conclusion of the CMC investigation? What evidence did the Scripps faculty consider in reaching its judgment that the CMC report was in error? Recently, a photograph of the incident was published that provides additional evidence that for at least a time the demonstrating students blocked access to Collins Hall. The photograph can be viewed here:\u000ahttp://www.jewishpress.com/news/cockroach-curses-and-jew-hunting-in-california-colleges/2013/05/10/\u000aThe CMC faculty have seen no report that contradicts the facts adduced by the investigation conducted by the CMC Dean of Students. We have seen a statement by President Trombley of Pitzer College that takes issue with the message that President Gann of CMC sent to the Claremont Colleges community. Yet, here is part of President Trombley\u2019s description of the March 4 incident in her memorandum of April 26:\u000a\u201cDuring the street theater event, the CMC Dean of Students appeared and asked that they move so as to not impede access to the front entrance of the dining hall. The students complied. The students also were asked two other times to move; first by a food services manager and then by a campus safety officer. The students complied.\u201d\u000aIf this account is accurate, the students of SJP blocked access to the dining hall at least twice, and perhaps three times: first, when the CMC Dean of Students asked them to move; a second time when the food service manager asked them to move; and (although this is not entirely clear from President Trombley\u2019s account) a third time when the campus safety officer asked them to move. But whether there were two or three separate blockages, President Trombley\u2019s account seems to confirm, not contradict, the conclusion of the CMC investigation.\u000aIn her communications to the Claremont Colleges community of March 15, April 19, and May 7, President Gann reported the following facts: (1) in the days immediately following the March 4 incident CMC launched a detailed investigation of the incident conducted by the Dean of Students; (2) CMC facilitated an informal grievance process chaired by the CMC Dean of Faculty after the Pitzer student filed an informal written grievance; (3) the parties to this informal process failed to reach a resolution; (4) CMC then completed its investigation after interviewing 11 witnesses and relevant documents; (5) during and after the informal grievance process the Pitzer student and/or his support person were responsible for breaches of confidentiality; (6) after the informal grievance process failed, the Pitzer student filed a formal grievance; and (7) when the Pitzer student and his support person made clear that they would not abide by CMC\u2019s confidentiality requirements going forward, CMC dismissed the student\u2019s formal grievance complaint against the CMC faculty member.\u000aPresident Gann also reported that (1) the CMC faculty member was publicly admonished for his inappropriate statements to the student and has been subject to further discipline; (2) that the faculty member has acknowledged that his statements were inappropriate and unprofessional and has apologized for his statements; and (3) that though the faculty member\u2019s statements were inappropriate and unprofessional, they were not so severe or pervasive as to constitute a violation of the College\u2019s Harassment Policy. Yet, these actions by CMC were simply ignored by the Scripps faculty, as if CMC had done nothing in response to the March 4 incident.\u000aIt is our hope that deliberation on this or other controversial matters affecting the Claremont Colleges will be fully informed by all the relevant facts.\u000aSincerely,\u000a[At this point, 46 members of the CMC faculty sign the statement.]\u000aShare this:Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)MoreClick to print (Opens in new window)Click to share on Pinterest (Opens in new window)Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)Click to share on Google+ (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Tags: CMC Faculty Statement Raviv Scripps SJPCategories: Campus News

aS'A Call for Tolerance'
p1226
aVBy Kyle Woods \u2013 Guest Contributor\u000a \u000aTolerance is a cornerstone of American thought. Whether or not you believe in conservative or liberal ideals, it is generally understood that as Americans we should be tolerant of all viewpoints. While we have struggled with this in the past, I proudly believe that we have developed a widening tolerance in recent decades. Our tolerance and open-mindedness as a nation sets us apart as a beacon for free speech and thought. Unfortunately there has been a disturbing trend of intolerance on our campuses here recently. While students here may propagate conservative economic thinking, there are relatively few political conservatives, and to admit that you are a conservative or a Republican certainly has a stigma attached to it.\u000aSome of the progressives here at the 5Cs are more than happy to support and promote this stigma. Supporting this stereotype elevates the partisanship of both groups, breeding more extreme thought on both sides of the aisle. When progressives immediately impose stereotypes upon Republicans or conservatives, this only deepens the resolve of Republican students and creates a more partisan atmosphere. To be a Republican on our campuses is to be an elitist snob who seeks to control women and who wants to make the rich richer and the poor poorer. This is far from the truth, and our Republican students deserve the right to be judged upon their actions and beliefs rather than stereotypes. Stereotyping against liberal or progressive students does not occur nearly as often, and it should not occur at all. All of our students deserve to have their opinions judged by their merits rather than a label.\u000aRepublican students in 5C budget hearings should not be told by members of the budgeting committee to avoid playing intramural soccer because Republicans are only good at golf. I enjoy a good joke among friends about my political beliefs, but to be told out of malice that I should stick to certain sports and avoid others due to my political beliefs is beneath the caliber of discourse we maintain at the 5Cs. It is no different than saying that liberals are weak, and as such should avoid football because they cannot handle such a violent sport. Alternatively, this low form of stereotyping is a predecessor to more invasive judgments. A student at the 5Cs, or any human being for that matter, deserves to be heard. It is unlikely they have extreme beliefs. It is more likely as a Republican that they believe in conservative economic principles, smaller government, and more freedom for the individual who deserves protection from state intrusion into their life.\u000aI argue here not for a favorable view of the Republican Party, or that everyone should vote for Republican candidates; I\u2019ll save that for another day. Instead, I implore the students of our campuses to support tolerance of conservative thought in the same way we support tolerance of other beliefs. I argue for reason, compromise and intellectual discourse. I\u2019ve been here for four years now and have loved every one of them, but without a doubt there are students here whose opinions of me have been shaped entirely upon my identity as a Republican, and who think lesser of me for it. We are better than that. We are better than stereotyping, and we are better than thinking of people as nothing more than a label. We are the future leaders of this nation, and if we are not tolerant now, when will we ever be?\u000a \u000aImage Source: Metro\u000aShare this:Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)MoreClick to print (Opens in new window)Click to share on Pinterest (Opens in new window)Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)Click to share on Google+ (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Tags: Claremont Colleges Kyle Woods Republicans Stereotyping ToleranceCategories: Campus News Opinion

aS'Scripps Students concerned over new LASPA Center'
p1234
aVScripps College recently received a $5 million donation, a keystone gift from alumnus Eileen Schock Laspa \u201967 and Jude Laspa, Harvey Mudd College \u201965, for a women\u2019s leadership center to be named in honor of the former.\u000aThe LASPA Center for Leadership at Scripps College will focus on 21st-century leadership, including scholarship and public service. The center has a focused mission of preparing enriched, informed, intellectual and curious female leaders of tomorrow by increasing interactions with local organizations and working with community leaders.\u000aHaving led adventurous lives, including moving 16 times, the Lapsas carry a very global perspective, which they would like the center to reflect. Yet, the family does not intend to hold any administrative position or have any involvement in the running of the center. According to Scripps President Lori Bettison-Varga, during an April 15 LAPSA information session, \u201cThey are not going to control it; they just gave us a gift to help us to steward the project.\u201d She went on to say that they will not be part of the search committee for the director either, nor will have any special vetting of the candidate.\u000aAlthough much of the administration is excited about bringing new opportunities to campus, Scripps students are unsure of the benefits of such a center and have been vocal about their concerns. Chief among their worries is the thought that the institute could become like CMC\u2019s Kravis Leadership Institute and not adequately embody all Scripps students, but only certain majors.\u000aVarga and faculty members Piya Chatterjee, Dorothy Cruickshank Backstrand Chair of Gender and Women\u2019s Studies, and Mark Golub, Assistant Professor of Politics and International Relations, held a panel discussion April 15 to get feedback on the program and help answer student questions. President Varga started off the hour-long discussion by giving students a broad overview of the project and then opened the floor up for a dialogue.\u000aThe leadership center will enhance the current curriculum with the hope that it may become the hub and heart beat outside the classroom of engaging students. The goals for the center are ambitious and include research grants, among other opportunities for students. Similar to CMC\u2019s SOURCE program, the LASPA center hopes to allow students to work directly with non-profits and local companies throughout the year, allowing students to problem solve \u201creal world\u201d problems for organizations outside of the consortium. The center also hopes to have visiting scholars and host practical skill-based workshops, as well as have student-run conferences.\u000aPresident Varga notably stressed that the center is \u201cnot going to be Kravis Center at Scripps.\u201d Rather, the programming is supposed to affect all students in their four years at the college, with series such as, \u201cMoney Wise Woman Program,\u201d how best to negotiate your paycheck, and similar practical skills necessary for life after college.\u000aThe center will have directives unique to Scripps culture, which will interest all students with room for different views of leadership. It will have characteristics that are necessary for anyone to successfully lead their own lives and work with others. The benefits from the center do not end when one graduates, but will be available even beyond through the LASPA center\u2019s virtual website, which will include alumni relations support.\u000aNow that the project has received the initial gift, the school has put together a search committee for the center\u2019s inaugural director. The college wants to make sure that students help out in the search of the right person as well. To accommodate them, there will be public, on-campus interviews of candidates beginning in the fall of 2013. The physical location of the center will be in the Drake wing of Dennison Library, which has been closed for three years. Although it will be housed in a very historic building, the center plans to be very contemporary and high tech inside, with sliding walls and state of the art equipment.\u000aOverall, the center will bring a much-needed resource to the Scripps community. The college has lacked a place to provide students with necessary post-graduate tools, and the addition of the center will be a welcome sight. Historically, Scripps has succeeded in preparing its students to enter the workforce academically, but alumni have expressed a lack of technical work place preparation. Hopefully, the LASPA Center will be able to help correct these past grievances.\u000aShare this:Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)MoreClick to print (Opens in new window)Click to share on Pinterest (Opens in new window)Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)Click to share on Google+ (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Tags: Ambika Bist Kravis Center LASPA Center President Varga ScrippsCategories: Campus News

aS'Please Allow Immigrants to Keep My Taxes Low'
p1238
aVIn wake of the April 15 bombings in Boston, the eight Senate members tasked with addressing current immigration woes have decided to postpone moving forward. Members of the working group, four Republicans and four Democrats, are not able to discuss the provisions of the bill publicly until it is finalized, according to an article published in the Wall Street Journal. As both brothers accused of setting off the bombs had legally immigrated to the United States, Senator Charles Grassley (R-Iowa), believes the recent bombings pose the question, \u201cHow can we beef up security check on people who wish to enter the United States?\u201d\u000aLet\u2019s be honest with ourselves. We all know the concern is not about security checks, pre-Boston bombings or post-Boston bombings. According to the United States Department of Homeland Security, in 2012, 757,434 people were naturalized. Therefore, the two men accused of the Boston Marathon bombings represent 0.00026% of naturalized citizens just including the year 2012 alone. Moreover, in the past 20 years of my life, 17 individual bombings by U.S.-born citizens have taken place, each killing multiple people.\u000aSecurity concern or not, there are 11 million illegal immigrants, more than 3.5% of the total population of the United States, waiting for a change to happen. The recent Senate bill released, as the Wall Street Journal reported, included \u201can eventual pathway to citizenship, but only after a series of \u2018triggers\u2019 are met to enhance border security.\u201d Border security enhancement or not, 11 million people already made it. The existence of more security along the Mexican/U.S. border is simply not going to change anything. The \u201cproblem\u201d itself, historically speaking, is a new social construct. No problem actually exists. Never before has the movement of people across countries been so low. Never before, in the history of other civilizations, has a government attempted with such brute force to restrict the imminent, natural flow of people to such a devastatingly low degree. Even the Great Wall of China didn\u2019t span the entire length of the empire, as plans for changes in the Mexican/U.S. border propose.\u000aIn fact, rather, what exists is an opportunity\u2014an opportunity to ensure the United States remains the largest economy in the United States. Projected to surpass us soon is China, a country with a population of 1.344 billion. With the current United States population at 313 million, China is more than one billion people ahead of the United States.\u000aAbsurdity. That is the only word that comes to my mind when I read these current population statistics. There is simply no imaginable way to compete with a work force more than four times greater than ours. A group of 429 people is unquestionable going to be more productive than a group of 100, regardless of improvements in technology. Looking at the bigger picture, three things matter in an economy: land, labor, and capital. Despite increases in communication assisted by globalization, we are not living in a time of the greatest flows of land, labor, and capital. That already passed in 1973 with the end of the Bretton Woods system. Far past the search for ghost acres and the need of exploiting land merely for food sustenance, land changes won\u2019t contribute to the prosperity of the United States anytime soon. Therefore, looking ahead to keep our dominance from an economic perspective, we are only able to look to our capital levels and our labor levels. According to economist Barry Eichengreen\u2019s recently published book, Exorbitant Privilege: The Rise and Fall of the Dollar and the Future of the International Monetary System, one-fifth of all tax dollars are currently committed to interest payments alone to satisfy the debt of the United States. Given our debt situation, the United States can\u2019t hope to maintain dominance using levels of available capital.\u000aA visit to the Athenaeum by acclaimed French economist and philosopher Dr. Guy Sorman, however, convinced me, from the standpoint of a history major, not to entirely lose hope. As Dr. Sorman exclaimed, \u201cYou can see the future as a threat or an opportunity.\u201d\u000aAn opportunity is exactly what my grandfather saw when he came to complete his medical residency in the United States from Cuba in 1954. However, the opportunity was not only to complete his residency. Despite many pleas to contribute his knowledge to Cuba as the number one student in his graduating medical school class, he preferred the opportunities offered to him in the United States. Similar to the United States\u2019 current economic standing, it is crucial Americans view each immigrant as an opportunity, and a last hope, for continued prosperity rather than an apocalyptic disaster waiting to happen. Each immigrant is an opportunity to improve our labor productivity and, more importantly, an opportunity to once again reach a viable level of competition in the world labor market.\u000aThe restrictions on immigration, from a historical standpoint, have never been as high as they are today. Clever politicians stating there are more immigrants living in the United States than at any other time are correct; with the monumental increase in population that has occurred over the past century, the physical number of immigrant is higher than ever. As a percentage of total population, however, it is at a low point.\u000aWhy is immigration from a historical standpoint so crucial to our economic prosperity? Population is a key determinant of economic size. Plain and simple. Eichengreen writes in his book, \u201cA stagnant population will mean a stagnant economy.\u201d While the U.S. is still the largest economy in the world due to its incumbent position, with the possibility of a stagnant population, we will without a doubt fall form this position. There is no feasible way that China, with an additional billion people, will not out-produce our economy. From a competitive standpoint, we are poised to lose. Additionally, to put this vast gap into perspective, the difference in population between the United States and Russia at the end of the Cold War, seen to be impossible to compensate for, was a mere 40 million people. To reach the population level of Russia, the United States would have only needed to increase its population by 16 percent.\u000aWill we feel this fall from incumbency? Let\u2019s take Japan as a case study, as Dr. Sorman pointed out. Currently, Japan is facing zero economic growth. Moreover, the population is decreasing, failing to even remain stagnant. Does the rule hold that population determines economic size? From the point of view of an average Japanese constituent, it apparently does not. With a decrease in population, income for each individual has actually increased. While Japan is receding on the global market, the common constituent feels no sense of crisis. Yet.\u000aThe common American citizen, the generation of current policymakers, specifically, may not feel our fall from hegemony. My generation will.\u000aMost importantly, my generation will feel the increase in taxes. Even for those who argue that a fall from hegemony may not be that bad, it will undoubtedly mean an increase in taxes. According to Dr. Sorman, it is possible to attribute a country\u2019s propensity to redistribute income to the uniformity of its population. Countries with greater homogeneity redistribute income at much higher rates than those with heterogeneity in their population.\u000aIn the long run, without immigration reform, the United States will see no economic growth, if not a decrease in economic growth, a fall from a position of hegemony, and an increase in taxes as the population increases in homogeneity. Our only hope for a continued rise in economic growth, fostered by a change in labor, is a substantial growth in population. An increase in immigration, and the subsequent increase in population, is our last hope to even have a shot at remaining as a dominant economic and global power.\u000aShare this:Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)MoreClick to print (Opens in new window)Click to share on Pinterest (Opens in new window)Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)Click to share on Google+ (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Tags: China Cuba Guy Sorman Immigration reform Lynsey Chediak Population TaxesCategories: Opinion

aS'The Financial Aid Fiscal Cliff'
p1242
aVClaremont McKenna College President Pamela Gann sent an email to the CMC student body March 14 announcing the termination of the college\u2019s \u201cNo Packaged Loans policy,\u201d a financial aid policy which previously prohibited the inclusion of student loans in student financial aid packages. The policy was changed so that as much as $4,000 in loans could be included in annual financial aid packages for future classes, amounting to a maximum of $16,000 in student loan debt for CMC students upon graduation.\u000aThe change understandably upset many in the CMC community who worried about the policy change\u2019s effects on socioeconomic diversity at the college. Legitimate fears surfaced that an additional $16,000 in loans could easily be significant enough to deter low-income students from attending the college. The conclusion of a historic fund-raising campaign, which brought CMC\u2019s endowment to a whopping $600 million, also made many students and alumni alike skeptical of claims that maintaining the No-Loans Policy was fiscally unfeasible  The fact that the No-Loans policy cancellation coincided with the announcement by the CMC Administration of plans to build a new, state-of-the-art fitness center certainly did not serve as a selling point either. Echoing the concerns and opinions of many within the CMC community, Senior Class President-elect Laura Epstein even penned an op-ed for the CMC Forum titled \u201cInvest in Students, Not a New Gym\u201d shortly after President Gann\u2019s announcement.\u000aFortunately, the voices of concern within the CMC community elicited a prompt response from the administration. Dean Jefferson Huang came before the ASCMC Senate April 2 to explain in detail the justifications behind the cancellation of the No-Loans Policy. He began by explaining the three pillars of CMC\u2019s financial aid policy prior to the change: need-blind admission, meeting all need, and the now-defunct No Packaged Loans. Huang explained that, despite the best efforts of the administration, the Financial Aid Office had overspent by about $900,000 the previous year, even after exhausting both a $14 million financial aid fund from the college\u2019s own pockets and about $4 million more in state and federal government grants.

aS'What\xe2\x80\x99s in a feminist? Implications of the Roe v. Wade 40th Anniversary Celebration'
p1246
aVOn Tuesday, Jan. 22, the CMC \u201cE-memo Digest\u201d announced a Roe v. Wade 40th Anniversary Celebration to be held the following day. The flyer appended to the memo invited students to join Professors Amanda Hollis-Brusky and N. Ann Davis of Pomona College for a conversation followed by a question and answer session, and specified \u201cCake and refreshments provided!\u201d\u000aThe Pomona College Gender & Women\u2019s Studies, Intercollegiate Women\u2019s Studies of the Claremont Colleges, Pomona College Women\u2019s Union, and Pomona College Student Affairs Office jointly sponsored the event.\u000aAfter four long months, I have finally garnered the boldness to express my unease with the Roe v. Wade 40th Anniversary Celebration. The mere occurrence of this event provokes in me great concern regarding the discourse surrounding reproductive rights at the Claremont Colleges. I write out of serious concern that the feminist dialogue at the Claremont Colleges has deemed it appropriate to celebrate abortion rights in a party atmosphere with cake and refreshments.\u000aI do not intend to provoke debate about the ethical questions surrounding abortion and whether the government should control it. However, I do intend to question whether a party that celebrates abortion rights with cake is consistent with the sensitivity and respect for human dignity that the 5C community proclaims to uphold.\u000aWhether we believe that abortion should be legal or illegal, federally funded or unfunded\u2014that doesn\u2019t really matter here. What matters is the nature of the circumstances that lead women to seek abortion in the first place.\u000aIt is tragic that any woman should ever find herself in a position in which she feels that she must or should terminate a pregnancy\u2014whether because of a heinous crime that caused the pregnancy, a danger the fetus poses to the mother\u2019s life, concerns about the baby\u2019s health and well-being as potentially severely disabled, or circumstances such as poverty and destitution that render child-rearing an unfeasible task.  Sometimes the circumstances are less dramatic\u2014a woman who could feasibly raise a child simply doesn\u2019t want to, and thus terminates the pregnancy. This still does not seem to me a reason to celebrate.\u000aTo celebrate the right to procure an abortion with cake and refreshments trivializes the sadness and despair so frequently associated with the procedure. Abortion is not a decision made lightly, and often involves extensive suffering in a woman\u2019s life. Whether we believe that the woman should be free to terminate the pregnancy isn\u2019t relevant. What is relevant is that the circumstances that so often accompany the procedure render abortion hardly a cause of celebration.\u000aBut it\u2019s not so much the event itself that concerns me. If a 5C pro-choice activist student group had hosted a Roe anniversary celebration on its own, I would find myself much less distraught. What is particularly offensive about this event is that Pomona College and the Intercollegiate Women\u2019s Studies departments themselves sponsored it.\u000aSuch a department-sponsored \u201ccelebration\u201d of abortion rights stifles the educational goals of creating dialogue and discourse regarding reproductive rights. The consortium\u2019s educating authority on women\u2019s studies hosting this event suggests that proper feminism necessitates the glorification of abortion rights to a degree at which it\u2019s appropriate to celebrate with cake.  It\u2019s to suggest that one cannot be a feminist or a scholar of women\u2019s studies without enthusiastically supporting abortion. It\u2019s to suggest that there\u2019s a \u201cright\u201d way to do feminism\u2014and that the way is to adopt a hard-left stance on reproductive rights.\u000aThe wealth of philosophical, psychological, medical, ethical, and theological scholarship that is less-than-enthusiastic about abortion rights and the Roe decision demonstrate that, in fact, there is currently no established \u201cright\u201d way to do feminism. To sponsor a Roe v. Wade 40th Anniversary Celebration party disregards such scholarship. This is not education, but rather ideological indoctrination. It should thus come as no surprise that the general consensus pervading the Claremont Colleges is that feminism necessitates enthusiastic support of abortion rights.\u000aThe Claremont Colleges proclaim to be bastions of women\u2019s empowerment, but the Roe v. Wade anniversary celebration, complete with cake and refreshments, leaves me feeling anything but empowered.\u000aShare this:Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)MoreClick to print (Opens in new window)Click to share on Pinterest (Opens in new window)Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)Click to share on Google+ (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Tags: Abortion Amelia Evrigenis Cake Feminism Gender studies Roe v.

aS'Thatcher, the Conviction Politician'
p1254
aV\u000aDeveloping into a \u201cCalifornia conservative\u201d at the beginning of the 21st century, it was challenging to find the ideal ideological role model in the public sphere. Sure, there were elder figures like John McCain or Colin Powell who had remarkable records of achievement. There were distant, historical figures like Abraham Lincoln or Winston Churchill, leaders in times of crisis who I studied but had a hard time relating to in a time of plenty and relative security. There were public writers who were bold, clear, and intellectual. Peggy Noonan, George Will, and Thomas Sowell come to mind. But they were limited in reach to print media and Sunday shows. There were, however, two universally exalted figures in conservative circles. One, it goes without saying, was Ronald Reagan. The other, somewhat less deified figure: Baroness Margaret Thatcher.\u000aWith time, and, frankly, with the help of YouTube, I discovered the brilliance of Lady Margaret Thatcher, Britain\u2019s first female Prime Minister, and the longest serving PM in the 20th century, who recently passed away in London.\u000aThatcher was different. Thatcher earned her own term, Thatcherism, not just because of her policies, but also because of her personal power while advocating for her (classically) liberal philosophy. Although I was born after she fell from power, after several years looking back at her speeches, interviews, and actions, I am struck by an unparalleled aura of raw strength that radiated from every part of her being.\u000aWith all the talk of how conservatives are engaging in a \u201cWar on Women,\u201d the idea that a woman led the Conservatives may seem odd today. For Thatcher, however, her sex was not the issue. Her vision was. Through artful maneuvering, she rose from Education Minister to leader of the Tories in 1975. A few short years later, she moved into 10 Downing Street.\u000aThatcher\u2019s indomitable will is widely viewed as both her most damaging flaw and greatest virtue. It endeared her to her allies, and further alienated her from her opponents. Thatcher\u2019s steely resolve also set her apart from other leaders. She called herself a \u201cconviction politician\u201d rather than a \u201cconsensus politician,\u201d although she did compromise on occasion. Some would charitably call her conviction stubbornness, evinced when she declared she was \u201cextraordinarily patient, provided I get my own way in the end.\u201d\u000aPerhaps nowadays, fighting for freedom around the world is a stale notion, but Thatcher was on the forefront of the battle against Communism in all its ugly forms, and championed freedom, both personal and economic, at home in Britain and past the Iron Curtain. She quickly embraced a title invented by a Russian reporter a year after she became the opposition leader, when she remarked, \u201cYes I am an iron lady\u2026 if that\u2019s how [the Soviets] wish to interpret my defense of values and freedoms fundamental to our way of life.\u201d\u000aWhy was Thatcher so determined, so stubborn in promoting her ideology? Part of it can be attributed to Britain\u2019s parliamentary system, which gave her total control over the government as long as she remained leader of the majority and had the support of her lieutenants. I would argue that the parliamentary structure was built for Thatcher\u2019s style of leadership. It did not make Thatcher, but rather enabled Thatcher to be the leader she was. After a lifetime observing politics, she knew what she thought, and if she could, she would implement her preferred policies. In 1968, even before she became party leader, observing weakness in many of Britain\u2019s leaders, she warned that \u201cThere are dangers in consensus: it could be an attempt to satisfy people holding no particular views about anything. \u2026 No great party can survive except on the basis of firm beliefs about what it wants to do.\u201d

p1258
aV\u000aClaremont Mckenna College President Pamela Gann sent out an email April 19 regarding the confrontation between a member of the Students for Justice in Palestine (SJP) organization and a CMC faculty member. The email included a forwarded memo from Dean of Students Mary Spellman, and summarized the findings of the six-week investigation that the school had conducted. In those intervening six weeks, the incident and the subsequent investigation has been discussed at length in the student media and in the general student body. While the appropriateness and meaning of the professor\u2019s words were scrutinized, along with the investigation\u2019s alleged increased interest in SJP\u2019s adherence to event protocol, the effectiveness and even the fundamental necessity of the school\u2019s policy on demonstrations and free speech were not. These policies have produced a substantial amount of the frustration with these proceedings. Among these policies, both CMC\u2019s policy on demonstrations and general events, as well as the Consortium\u2019s \u201cbias-related incident\u201d policy are substantially responsible for the deafening lack of important discourse on the topic.\u000aThe policy on demonstrations has been addressed in other publications, but the \u201cbias-related incident\u201d policy, which has received less coverage, poses a similar if not more insidious threat to freedom of speech. This threat stems from the policy\u2019s mere existence, as it can be used to silence and discredit opponents by mere insinuation. In this case, a Pitzer student, Najib Hamideh \u201915, claimed that Dr. Yaron Raviv, a CMC associate professor, used racially charged language when addressing him. The longrunning investigation noted that Raviv apologized for the inappropriateness of his language, and also indicated that Raviv \u201cstated that his intent in using the term \u2018cockroach\u2019 was to respond to the student by indicating that he thought of the student as someone who could not harm him.\u201d Raviv also said that his harsh outburst was in response to Hamideh saying, \u201cYou\u2019re a faculty here. I will hunt you down,\u201d which Hamideh denied saying. In addition the report also noted that after the confrontation, Hamideh returned to the demonstration and attempted to identify the professor, when, \u201cAt least one witness reported that, while doing so, the student stated that he would \u2018hunt down\u2019 the faculty member. The student did not recall making the statement but did not deny doing so.\u201d Such facts cast a new light on this incident, and add doubt to the prevailing version of the story. These new facts do change the discussion, but what was said and by whom should not have been at issue in this case. That these were the relevant questions covered by student media represents the failings of our current speech policy.

aS'Hail Politically Correct, Hail'
p1262
aVAs hundreds of Pomona College alumni descend upon the campus for Alumni Weekend May 2-5, there are sure to be graduates looking to relive their glory days through reverent nostalgia, whimsical antics and general drunkenly disorder.\u000aIn addition, while jaunting about their stomping grounds of yesteryear, many Pomona grads will likely sing their school\u2019s alma mater, Hail Pomona, Hail, as alums are wont to do.\u000aYet, few current students will recognize the song as Pomona\u2019s alma mater. The hymn became controversial in the spring of 2008 after fliers appeared across the campus linking the song\u2019s inception to a blackface minstrel show performed as early as 1909. While the song itself contains no offensive lyrics, this apparently sordid pedigree has tainted the image of the song in the eyes of the Pomona administration.\u000aPresident David Oxtoby sent a letter to the Pomona College community Dec. 15, 2008, writing that, \u201cGiven the divisive nature of the song on campus\u2026 it will not be included in programs for Commencement or Convocation for the present.\u201d However, he also \u201cdecided to confirm Hail Pomona, Hail as Pomona\u2019s Alma Mater and to end the suspension of performances at official college events such as Alumni Weekend.\u201d\u000aThis was certainly an odd turn of events. If the song is truly bigoted and immoral, then why not comprehensively ban it from all college functions?  Pomona\u2019s demographically driven ban\u2014a musical score forbidden for current students but \u201cconfirmed\u201d for aging alums\u2014results in a philosophical no-man\u2019s-land of carefully considered interests. This \u201cselective\u201d prohibition both appeases youthful rage and alumni nostalgia\u2014the latter a sentiment that often propels donor wallets.\u000aHypocrisy aside, and regardless of whether the song was actually performed as part of a blackface minstrel show (a charge comprehensively refuted in a well-researched report by Pomona alumnus Rosemary Choate \u201963 in 2008), the notion that one must ban anything with unsavory historical roots borders on the ridiculous.\u000aIndeed, President Oxtoby acknowledged this point in his decision, writing, \u201cthere is the troubling idea that all things associated with an imperfect past should be considered tainted even if there is nothing inherently objectionable about them.\u201d\u000aAnd yet, Pomona apparently got over that trouble and imposed the ban on Hail Pomona, Hail anyway.\u000aAnother troubling idea about the decision: What\u2019s the limiting principle? Where to start? Where to end?\u000aIf one were to implement Pomona\u2019s historical purity policy across every American institution, a vast array of professional sports associations, newspapers and magazines, and a lion\u2019s share of the colleges and universities would have to be discontinued in the name of political correctness.\u000aIn the realm of music alone, notable tunes like the Star-Spangled Banner could potentially be deemed politically incorrect due to their nefarious origins. The melody of the Star-Spangled Banner was taken from a drinking song popular at an all-male social club in London. By Pomona\u2019s standards, the national anthem has got to go.\u000aAnd what of art or cinema? Should we ban masterpieces because their creators may have held racist or sexist beliefs irrelevant to the overall significance of their work? Walt Disney was infamously rumored to be anti-Semitic (a charge contested by many who knew him), yet we continue to enjoy movies and products branded with his name.\u000aIndeed, Walt Disney\u2019s nephew, Roy, was a Pomona alum from the class of 1951 and for whom the \u201cRoy Edward Disney Professor of Creative Writing\u201d at Pomona is obviously named. Is the close nephew of a rumored anti-Semite sufficiently proximate ground on which to rid the faculty of any association with the Disney name? The logic of Pomona\u2019s decision inevitably takes us to some pretty untenable places.\u000aMore important, Pomona College missed a crucial opportunity to teach its students an enduring lesson through the whole song debacle. Instead of trying to cover up the past or pretend that racism didn\u2019t (and doesn\u2019t) exist (even if it didn\u2019t actually exist, in this case), why not try to examine more fully the connections between racism and sexism in history and culture and try to learn how to stop them from spreading to other spheres of influence?\u000aPomona chose to shut down further discussion in the name of avoiding \u201cdivisiveness.\u201d In doing so, Pomona improperly elevated perceived student unity over the essential core value of the university in civil society: discovering the truth through never-ending discourse, dialogue and debate.\u000aPresident Oxtoby imposed his campus ban on Hail Pomona, Hail only \u201cfor the present.\u201d Nearly five years later, perhaps it\u2019s now time to revisit the wisdom of that misguided prohibition.\u000aCensorship via political correctness is not the solution to discrimination; rather, censorship merely allows more subtle forms of bias to fester beneath the surface of silence.\u000aShare this:Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)MoreClick to print (Opens in new window)Click to share on Pinterest (Opens in new window)Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)Click to share on Google+ (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Tags: Alma Mater Brad Richardson Censorship Politically Correct PomonaCategories: Campus News Opinion

p1266
aVIn a recent school-wide ballot measure, 78 percent of Pomona College students voted to request that the administration divest portions of the college\u2019s $1.7 billion endowment currently invested in fossil fuels. The April 9 landslide vote was widely hailed by progressive-minded students at the Claremont Colleges as a sign of environmental consciousness and a step forward for sustainability.\u000aHowever, others have asserted that the recently passed divestment measure does not go far enough. Riding on the coattails of their overwhelming victory, some Pomona College student leaders of the Claremont Colleges Divestment Campaign (CCDC) have already announced just weeks after their historic win that they have drafted a new ballot measure and will be calling for yet another referendum before the end of the semester.\u000aThe referendum, dubbed \u201cDivestment 2.0,\u201d is rumored to contain provisions that provide for a complete distancing of Pomona College students from the \u201cimmoral fossil fuel economy.\u201d If passed, it would require the entire Pomona College campus and student body be moved to the Amish countryside of Western Pennsylvania, where Pomona college students will learn the \u201ctrue meaning of sustainability.\u201d Megan Torukmakto PO \u201915, one of the most prominent voices favoring divestment at Pomona College, helped draft the new resolution and is one of its strongest supporters.\u000a\u201cThere was definitely an element of hypocrisy that came with the initial vote for divestment\u201d said Megan. \u201cIt didn\u2019t make sense for Pomona College students who voted for divestment to continue flying to Australia during the summer to conduct anthropological studies on feminism in modern aboriginal society. Trips like that spew about a thousand pounds of carbon into the atmosphere and we don\u2019t even give it a second thought.\u201d Torukmakto also lamented the fact that the majority of Pomona College students have continued to purchase Apple products manufactured in the coal-guzzling factories of urban China.\u000aKaie Arons PO\u201915 expressed similar sentiments, saying, \u201cIt\u2019s contradictory for Pomona College students to make such a sweeping symbolic move to separate itself from fossil fuels, yet continue consuming so many products made from fossil fuels. Even the posters we made for our March 4th divestment rally were made from paper produced by polluting mills. Divestment 2.0 will finally give CCDC the chance to organize sustainable demonstrations.\u201d\u000aDespite Pomona College President David Oxotoby\u2019s concerns that the lack of fossil-fueled technology, including computers, printers, and electric lighting, will hamper the institution\u2019s quality of education, student proponents of Divestment 2.0 have insisted that the college\u2019s future location will be just as robust of a learning environment. Supporters of Divestment 2.0 are rumored to have already begun reprinting textbooks on hand-made paper using the Honnold-Mudd Library printing press. Students in the college\u2019s science department have also begun blowing glass beakers and test tubes for use in the college\u2019s future log-cabin labs. These and many other fossil fuel-free educational materials will be transported in a covered-wagon train along with Pomona College\u2019s over 1500 students once the referendum passes.\u000aIn addition to the usual courses in science, English, foreign languages, and mathematics, students at Pomona College\u2019s new sustainable campus will offer new sustainability courses taught by local Amish, which will include Organic Corn farming 50, Intro to Husbandry, Weaving 1A and 2B, Barn-raising 101 and more. Although some of these courses will become part of Pomona College\u2019s general education requirements, proponents of Divestment 2.0 have stated that vegans will be exempt from classes on ranching, egg farming and dairy-production.\u000aIn the meantime, Pitzer Anthropology Professor Daniel Seagull has announced his intention to draft Pitzer College\u2019s own version of Divestment 2.0, titled \u201cDivestment X-treme.\u201d In a stunning act of one-upmanship, Professor Seagull has suggested that Pitzer College\u2019s main campus be moved to the east coast of Brazil instead, where students will learn the skills and traditions of the Amazonian natives. Volunteers have already reportedly begun constructing Polynesian-style canoes using sustainable wood harvested from fallen trees. The 9,000-mile voyage to Pitzer College\u2019s new Brazilian campus will take the students around the southern tip of South America and is expected to take several months. Though use of the Panama Canal would substantially shorten the journey, proponents of Divestment X-treme have maintained that they refuse to utilize a monument of U.S. imperialist legacy in their travels.\u000aProfessor Seagull concluded in his official statement announcing Divestment X-treme that, \u201cUnlike our peers at Pomona College who seem to have neglected the environmental contributions of the oppressed and marginalized third world, we here at Pitzer have not.\u201d Pitzer students have generally welcomed Divestment X-treme as an opportunity to experience a non-Western form of sustainable living. Pitzer Student Senate Vice Chair Seabasstion Aguilar PZ \u201914 echoed these sentiments. \u201cSo much of liberal arts education is already built upon the white colonialist capitalist patriarchy,\u201d Aguilar said. \u201cIt would be a shame if we make sustainability education so Euro-centric as well.\u201d\u000aShare this:Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)MoreClick to print (Opens in new window)Click to share on Pinterest (Opens in new window)Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)Click to share on Google+ (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Tags: Derek Ko Divestment Humor Pitzer Pomona SatireCategories: Campus News Humor

aVBy Brad Richardson and Colin Spence\u000a \u000aUp until now, CMC Associate Professor of Economics Yaron Raviv has remained completely silent on his involvement in a March 4 conflict between himself and members of a pro-Palestine student group, Claremont Students for Justice in Palestine (SJP). When the Claremont Independent requested an interview March 12 via email, Raviv politely declined, saying he wanted to wait for the review process to take its course before going public with his side of the story.\u000aRaviv, an Israel native, has been accused of using a racial slur and offensive language when he called a Pitzer student and SJP member a \u201cfucking cockroach.\u201d The group also alleged that Raviv tried to shut down a demonstration that they were performing, which included checking IDs at the front entrance of Collins Dining Hall during dinner service in order to simulate a West Bank and Gaza Strip Israeli checkpoint.\u000aCMC President Pamela Gann sent an April 19 email to the Claremont Colleges Community reporting the findings of a comprehensive review conducted by the administration. Although Gann ruled that, \u201cThe CMC faculty member made statements to the Pitzer student that were inappropriate and unprofessional,\u201d she also wrote that, \u201ceven if bias is assumed, the comments made, when viewed in the context and in their totality, were not sufficiently severe or pervasive as to constitute a violation of the College\u2019s Harassment Policy.\u201d\u000aFurthermore, she ruled that, \u201cthe SJP event was not in compliance with CMC\u2019s Demonstrations Policy and the Claremont Colleges Demonstration Policy, both of which prohibit disruptive and/or non-peaceful events,\u201d and \u201cThe CMC faculty member did not improperly interfere with or attempt to stop the event.\u201d\u000aNow that the review is complete and the administration has ruled on its findings, Raviv agreed to take part in an interview with the Claremont Independent. Below is a transcript of that interview.\u000a \u000aCI: What happened the evening of March 4?\u000aRaviv: I was sitting in [my office] grading a midterm exam. It was around 5:20 and a Pitzer student called my office. He said, \u201cCan I come to your office? I really need your help.\u201d He sounded very distressed, and I said, \u201cSure, come to my office.\u201d He was probably just downstairs, and he got to my office in a minute. He said, \u201cListen, there is some demonstration in the dining hall.\u201d I said, \u201cOkay, calm down, let me\u2026go and check what is going on.\u201d So I [went] down to the dining hall, and once we [got] on the main sidewalk, he took a turn because he was afraid to be seen with me.\u000a \u000aCI: Did you know the student?\u000aRaviv: Yeah, I knew the student. He was not my student. He knew that I was Israeli. I met him once at some kind of social event.\u000a \u000aCI: What did you see when you got to the dining hall?\u000aRaviv: I saw a couple of students [handing out] some fliers, a couple of students standing on the side of Collins Dining Hall and crying, and I saw a line of students blocking the entrance to the dining hall.\u000aI went up to go into the dining hall and the students were standing shoulder to shoulder, and I could not pass. They told me, \u201cShow us your ID.\u201d I said, \u201cWhat?\u201d \u201cYeah, yeah, this is an Israeli checkpoint, show us your ID if you want to come inside.\u201d I said, \u201cI\u2019m not going to show you my ID. Have you ever seen an Israeli checkpoint?\u201d One of the students said, \u201cYeah, yeah, I saw an Israeli checkpoint.\u201d I said, \u201cWho is your leader? Who brought you here?\u201d Then they told me, \u201cWe don\u2019t have a leader. We\u2019ve come by ourselves, and this is an approved demonstration.\u201d I said, \u201cOkay, okay, let me in.\u201d They let me in, you know, so there was not any physical contact.\u000aI went inside the dining hall. I was looking for the dining hall manager. I called her from inside the kitchen and I told her, \u201cListen, the students have the right to demonstrate, they probably have approved that, but they cannot block the entrance. Please move them 10 feet aside. They can do their political activity there. Just move them 10 feet aside so they will not block the entrance and hassle students. That\u2019s illegal.\u201d She went outside and she talked with the students, and at first it looked like they complied. So they took off the ropes\u2014they had some ropes on the side of the dining hall\u2014and they moved aside. However, the moment she went inside, they immediately blocked the entrance again. I went inside the dining hall again. I was looking for [the dining hall manager], and I could not find her, so I went to the cashier and I asked her to use her phone. I called [Campus Safety]\u2014I was the one who called [Campus Safety]\u2014and I told the dispatcher, \u201cListen, the students have the right to demonstrate, but you need to send someone to move them 10 feet aside. They cannot block the entrance.\u201d\u000aThe [Campus Safety] officer arrived and he parked his car 30-40 feet south of the entrance in front of Story House. I saw the guy and wanted to go talk to him to explain what was going on. I started to walk toward his direction, and a [student from the demonstration approached me] and told me to my face, \u201cWho are you? Show me your ID! Are you faculty or a visitor? If you are a visitor, you cannot be on campus after 5:00 p.m. Show me your campus pass!\u201d I told him, \u201cI will never show you my ID. It\u2019s not your business who I am. I can be a faculty or a visitor; it\u2019s not your business.\u201d I kept walking toward the officer and this guy is in my face, you know, like overly aggressively. I started to talk with the [Campus Safety] officer and I said, \u201cListen, this student event has been approved for this demonstration, but they cannot block the entrance, you need to move them 10 feet aside.\u201d To give [the Campus Safety officer] some validity to what I was saying, I pulled out my faculty ID. The [student] who was in my face basically said, \u201cOh, you are faculty! I will hunt you down!\u201d And I said, \u201cWhat? You will hunt me down? You\u2019re a fucking, little cockroach.\u201d\u000aSo [the student] heard that and said, \u201cOh! Now I\u2019ve got you!\u201d The moment he said that, I was really concerned\u2014not because of the \u201ccockroach,\u201d I was concerned because of the f-word. I immediately disentangled because I didn\u2019t want there to be a physical [altercation], so I went back to the Pitzer student who had asked for my help. I told him, \u201cListen, campus safety is here. They will take it from there.\u201d And I left.\u000a \u000aCI: So, I\u2019d like to get more into what SJP accused you of. They accused you of trying to take down the event\u2014\u000aRaviv: Yeah, the two main accusations were, first, that I tried to take down the event. And then, they assumed that I meant to demean the other student as a Palestinian [through a racial slur]. So, first of all, you can read it in the report, I never asked that the event stop. I just asked that they move it 10 feet aside, and this was confirmed by [Campus Safety] and the dining hall manager. [Regarding] the \u201ccockroach,\u201d when I came home and told my wife [what had happened], I said I was really worried about the f-word and I didn\u2019t talk about the \u201ccockroach\u201d at all.\u000aFirst of all, Israelis do not use that kind of expression with respect to Palestinians\u2014that\u2019s a total lie. But I don\u2019t need to use this argument because there was no way that me, or any other person, could tell that the person in front of me was Palestinian. How could I know that he was a Palestinian? His English was much better than mine; he grew up here in the states. He, on the other hand, knew that I was an Israeli based on my accent when he said, \u201cI will hunt you down.\u201d\u000a \u000aCI: But you did know that this was a pro-Palestinian event.\u000aRaviv: Yeah, I knew that. But the probability that you see an American Jew is much higher than the chance that you see a Palestinian.\u000a \u000aCI: So you didn\u2019t know the student and you didn\u2019t know he was Palestinian before it was reported?

aS'Rumor has it: There\xe2\x80\x99s a Republican at Pitzer'
p1274
aVIt is usually assumed that Claremont\u2019s Republicans are housed at one of two schools, Claremont McKenna College or Pomona College. It is slowly being proven that this is not the case. In the 2012-13 school year the Claremont College Republicans received funding from all five schools, a feat that has never been accomplished before. I am proud to say that there are a couple Scripps students involved with the College Republicans and am personally happy to represent Scripps as Secretary of the club.\u000aThe Claremont College Republicans now boast a member of Pitzer College, freshman and class president Felix van Der Vaart. I had the opportunity to chat with Felix about his experiences in attending a notoriously liberal college as a conservative student.\u000aHow do you define your political views?\u000aI define myself as a conservative. Economically speaking, I am a big laissez-faire supporter and in general believe the less government intervention the better it is for the consumer and the \u201ccommon man.\u201d In this regard, I am also against progressive rate taxes. If you truly want to motivate the common man to innovate and take on the entrepreneurial spirit this nation was founded on, how can you expect to take away what he has earned and still motivate others to follow suit, knowing they will be treated similarly? People have a right to what they earn, plain and simple. In addition, allow individuals to donate where they choose. I don\u2019t want government making those decisions for me. Socially, I\u2019m also pretty conservative on most issues. While, admittedly there should be greater background checks within firearm sales (and to some degree, assault weapons aren\u2019t really needed by the common man), I am a firm believer in the right to bear arms and the Constitution as a whole. Once part of that is taken away from the people, the question becomes what piece of freedom is next to go? I am also pro-life. Since life is considered \u201cover\u201d when the heart stops beating, and since the human heart is beating 18 days into conception, I believe that abortion of the child after this is \u201cending a life\u201d unnaturally. However, as Church and State were meant to be separate, I don\u2019t believe gay marriage should even be an issue; people should be able to do as they please. This is part of the idea of government regulating more than they should.\u000aHow did you decide to join the Republican Party?\u000aI decided to join the Republican Party when I found it fit more of what I believe than the Democratic Party does. Note that no person should be totally aligned with one party. I think it\u2019s important for people to think through what they believe in, more than just based on what others are all believing or what is \u201cin\u201d at the time (bandwagon fallacy). Additionally, it is important to continue the discussion. Not being able to relate and discuss views with the opposing party prevents progress and limits (at the very least) one\u2019s understanding of a situation/issue.\u000aHow do you feel about being a Republican at Pitzer College?\u000aOverall, I like being a Republican at Pitzer. Sure, a couple people have written me off, but I still have found people who have been willing to discuss things respectfully and politely, and have had great discussions and widened my knowledge and appreciation for their different views. I will say it is frustrating sometimes as some of the boldest speakers who tend to dominate class discussions are not open to contrasting opinions and I have learned some \u201cbattles\u201d are not worth fighting, so to speak. Additionally, there really isn\u2019t any community in this regard for me, but I knew that coming in to this school and still am proud of what I believe and enjoy being around those who are interested in discussing issues in polite dialogue. Contrary to popular belief, Republicans have souls and do care about social issues and other people as well.\u000aAre other students accepting of your political views?\u000aA good amount of the students are accepting, but only a few are really open to discussing politics. I think a lot of accepting people are non-confrontational but that\u2019s understand- able with the general rush and hubbub of school life and work. That being said, I will say some people are not accepting, but that\u2019s something you have to deal with in going to one of the nation\u2019s most liberal colleges.\u000aDo you feel that you are as open about your political views as your peers are?\u000aI would say I am more open about my political views in most circumstances. That being said, I have chosen classes that are objectively graded (math and economics classes) to avoid any prejudice in grading that might come around from my contrasting beliefs. I think a lot of my peers don\u2019t talk much about their political views since the vast majority of people agree on their views.\u000aCongratulations on being Pitzer\u2019s freshman president. Can you talk a little about the election process you faced?\u000aI have to admit that I do not believe Pitzer\u2019s election cycle was nearly as advertised as some of the other 5Cs. I do know we had the highest amount of voters in school history during this election cycle (I want to say close to a third of freshmen voted), however. I know a couple of people knew I was conservative but a lot of them were my friends already and had seen I was open to discussion and didn\u2019t feel threatened by me. I guess the dialogue could not have been all negative as I was elected.\u000aHave you felt attacked due to your differing views?\u000aA couple of times but not regularly. I might get a skeptical look or a little judgment when I say something, but I have pretty thick skin from playing sports so it\u2019s nothing serious. Like I said, a lot of people are non-confrontational so I don\u2019t always feel attacked but I don\u2019t always feel welcomed either.\u000aShare this:Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)MoreClick to print (Opens in new window)Click to share on Pinterest (Opens in new window)Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)Click to share on Google+ (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Tags: Ambika Bist Felix van Der Vaart Pitzer Pitzer Republican RepublicanCategories: Campus News

aS'A call to stand with Rand'
p1278
aVIn December, I wrote an opinion article for the Claremont Independent titled \u201cAmerica Needs an Anti-war Revival.\u201d In it, I detailed the ways in which the Obama Administration has continued and even intensified the U.S.\u2019s War on Terror and how the civil liberties of all Americans were being threatened by a series of new policies and precedents set in the last few years. After the events of this past month, I am convinced more than ever that this trend is progressing.\u000aOn Mar. 4, 2013, U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder released a 16-page memo suggesting that the use of unmanned drones against U.S. citizens on American soil could be justified under \u201cextraordinary circumstances.\u201d  The idea that the President can authorize military violence domestically without due process is certainly an unprecedented and dangerous idea. Moreover, the current Justice Department\u2019s use of ambiguous language and lack of transparency makes it ever clearer that the current administration has little respect for constitutional restraints and civil liberties.\u000aFortunately, Senator Rand Paul (R) Kentucky filibustered the nomination of John Brennan as head of the CIA for 13 hours on Mar. 6, 2013, to demand clarification on the policy implications of the Holder memo. He sought an answer to the question of whether the President was authorized to kill U.S. citizens with domestic drones, an answer he had not been satisfactorily given despite two days of correspondence with the Justice Department. As one of the strongest voices for civil liberties in the U.S. Senate, Senator Paul single-handedly put the national spotlight upon a potentially egregious expansion of executive power. Thankfully, to the question of whether the President of the United States can authorize deadly force against fellow citizens, Senator Paul eventually received a hard-sought \u201cno\u201d for an answer. In an age of ever liberal interpretation of executive discretion, this sort of explicit clarification is absolutely necessary for drawing the line on government power.\u000aWith regard to the state of civil liberties in the United States in relation to the War on Terror, there is still much to worry about. However, the impact that Senator Paul\u2019s stand has made is ultimately a cause for optimism. Senator Paul\u2019s filibuster not only brought four of his GOP colleagues onto the floor in support, but also Senator Ron Wyden (D-Oregon) who welcomed discussion of domestic drones despite his support for Brennan\u2019s confirmation. The filibuster has gone viral on Facebook and Twitter feeds, garnering the attention and support of liberals and conservatives alike. Recently, even the Harvard Crimson, a prominent student publication at Harvard University which recently opined that conservatives \u201cneed not apply\u201d to their school, published an editorial voicing support of Senator Rand Paul titled We Stand with Rand. It would seem that Americans everywhere are at long last ready to tell the administration that enough is enough.\u000aFour months earlier, I pointed out the absence of the anti-war Left in protesting Obama\u2019s national security policies and abuses of executive power. While protests against the War on Terror in Washington still have not taken place on nearly the same scale as they did under George W. Bush, the widespread support Americans have given to Senator Rand Paul is encouraging. Even those who disagree with Senator Paul on everything else from fiscal policy to drug decriminalization have reason to commend him. In opposing the extrajudicial killings of U.S. citizens or innocent civilians abroad at the hands of our military, a good first gesture that all Americans can make is to stand with Rand. If the Harvard Crimson can do it, we all can.\u000a \u000aShare this:Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)MoreClick to print (Opens in new window)Click to share on Pinterest (Opens in new window)Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)Click to share on Google+ (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Tags: Civil liberties Derek Ko Filibuster Rand PaulCategories: Opinion

aS'Dean Spellman on the sexual violence procedures'
p1282
aVAfter initially responding to our request for an interview with a statement entitled \u201cRegarding Title IX,\u201d the Claremont McKenna Office of Public Affairs granted the CI an interview with Dean of Students Mary Spellman to discuss the college\u2019s Title IX sexual violence grievance procedures.\u000aClaremont McKenna College implemented new Civil Rights Policies and Civil Rights Grievance Procedures, which apply to cases of sexual violence, in accordance with a Dear Colleague Letter (DCL) issued by the Department of Education\u2019s Office of Civil Rights. The DCL, sent to all educational institutions in the United States that receive federal funding, stipulates numerous Title IX requirements to which recipients must adhere in investigating and resolving complaints of sexual violence. The most controversial of its contents is a requirement that schools use a preponderance of the evidence standard of proof in evaluating complaints of sexual violence. The preponderance standard is met if it is more likely than not (a greater than 50 percent probability) that the offense occurred. The DCL explicitly states that schools are not to use the clear and convincing standard (i.e. it is highly likely or reasonably certain that the offense occurred).\u000aWhen asked if Claremont McKenna College held any opinions about complying with the Department of Education\u2019s ultimatum regarding the preponderance standard, Dean Spellman responded that the decision-making standard is a minimally important aspect of the college\u2019s grievance procedures. She said, \u201cThe decision-making standard is the least important piece, I believe, in how we handle sexual violence cases or any kind of student conduct case. It\u2019s really about, \u2018Do we provide a fair and neutral and equitable process to all parties?\u2019 The decision-making standard is a small piece of that larger process.\u201d\u000aWhen asked more specifically if the college was concerned that the use of such a low standard would produce wrongful findings of guilt, Spellman responded similarly, saying that the low decision-making standard should not be of great concern. She said,\u000a\u201cThe [decision-making] standard is one piece of a very important process, so we need to make sure we have a process that\u2019s fair, that it has appropriate due process for all the parties, that the individuals, particularly the respondent, understands what their rights are and has a process by which the college has as much information as possible about the circumstance so that the trained investigator or trained hearing officer is able to make a fair, neutral and informed decision. So I think that that is the most important piece. We could have a higher decision-making standard, and if our process didn\u2019t have all of the robustness that our process does, you could still have a problem. It could be a different problem, but you\u2019re going to still have a problem. So the decision-making standard\u2014you know, preponderance or something else\u2014really, what\u2019s crucial is the process that you get to that. With preponderance of the evidence, if you have a process that is as robust as we want ours to be and we hope and think ours is, then the decision is easy at that point, because you have all the facts. The decision is either you do have enough information, or you don\u2019t. That\u2019s, to me, the most important piece.\u201d\u000aIn other words, if the college institutes robust grievance procedures that offer appropriate due process for all parties involved, it doesn\u2019t really matter whether the college uses a preponderance standard, a clear and convincing standard, or even a beyond a reasonable doubt standard. You either have enough information, or you don\u2019t.\u000aFor a perspective about why the decision-making standard does matter, and why the preponderance standard is a troubling aspect of CMC\u2019s grievance procedures, see our previous article \u201cTitle IX, sexual violence, and the preponderance standard.\u201d\u000a \u000aShare this:Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)MoreClick to print (Opens in new window)Click to share on Pinterest (Opens in new window)Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)Click to share on Google+ (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Tags: Amelia Evrigenis Dean Spellman Dear Colleague Letter Preponderance standard Sexual Violence Title IXCategories: Campus News

aS'5C divestment campaign: slaying (oil) giants or just tilting at windmills?'
p1286
aVAnthropogenic global warming, rising tides or melt­ing icecaps; these terms represent the burgeoning visibility and prevalence of the issues surrounding climate change. In modern political discourse, arguments about these issues grow increasingly contentious and urgent. This discourse has ex­panded into all corners of the country and also onto the 5Cs. Last semester, the 5C Student Divestment Campaign began to call for the Claremont Colleges \u201cto immediately freeze any new investment in fossil-fuel companies, and to divest within five years from direct ownership and from any commingled funds that include fossil-fuel public equities and corporate bonds.\u201d This campaign is a part of a larger, national campaign organized by 350.org, a website started by renowned environ­mentalist Bill McKibben, to convince schools, governments, religious institutions and other organizations to divest from the fossil fuel industry. This campaign though, while founded with good intentions, does have several key flaws.\u000aThere are several issues with this divestment campaign, both at the campus level and at the national campaign\u2019s level. At the 5Cs specifically, demands for equivalence between the schools ignores the financial realities at the differing institu­tions. At Pitzer, where endowment returns only cover five per­cent of operating costs, such a decision does not have the same substantial financial impact that the same decision does at Cla­remont McKenna or Pomona, where the endowments cover 28 percent and 40 percent, respectively, of operating costs. En­dowments usually rely upon stable long-term investments to provide consistent profits that then cover operating costs. Di­vesting from stable, mature industries like the traditional energy industry and transferring those funds to younger, more volatile alternative energy companies should not be undertaken lightly. In addition, the fact that representatives of the 5C divestment campaign argued that their efforts were based on \u201cmoral, sci­entific and philosophical\u201d reasons, coupled with the national campaign\u2019s claim that companies like Exxon and Chevron are \u201cvery risky investments,\u201d raises concerns that very real finan­cial considerations are being overlooked. Such companies are in fact blue chip stocks listed on the Dow Jones Industrial Av­erage, and represent stable and reliably profitable investment vehicles. Such considerations should not be ignored, especially at schools that rely upon endowment income to provide an ex­cellent education to its students. In the end, each institution will need to decide for itself whether or not divestment repre­sents the correct approach to climate change, whether such an approach can work within its investment strategy, and whether it is worth the costs. At the national and international level, the problems become more serious and wide-ranging, and even the efficacy of the divestment approach itself becomes suspect.\u000aDivestment became the activist approach du jour after the campaign to divest funds from Apartheid-era South Africa and has been suggested as a solution in subsequent campaigns against other nations and corporations. Whether it will work against a multi-national industry, however, is highly suspect. In the South African case, which 350.org freely admits inspired their campaign, the divestment campaign targeted a certain policy implemented by a single centralized authority. This fact meant that it was easy to target business activity in one very specific region without disrupting the global economy signifi­cantly. The United States did exactly this in the South African case when it passed the Comprehensive Anti-Apartheid Act of 1986, which banned all new U.S. trade and investment in the country. Now try to imagine the U.S. issuing a similar law in regards to the fossil fuel industry. The success of a divestment campaign, like the one imposed on South Africa, relies on high levels of participation. In the South African case, sanctions im­posed by the U.S., Europe and Japan enforced these levels of participation. Such laws are highly unlikely in the case of the fossil fuel industry.\u000aEven if the campaign intends to proceed based upon pri­vate decisions to divest, and attains some critical mass, the fact still remains that the industry is decentralized, and unless the pressure exerted by the campaign is uniform across the board, some companies will benefit whiles the others suffer. This is because instead of a single central authority, like a national government, there are multiple diverse and often unconnected groups to target. The 350.org campaign has identified 200 such entities for divestment, and a quick look at the top 25 reveals the incredible diversity between the firms.\u000aTo begin with, several of the top 25 companies are not listed on U.S. stock exchanges, and will thus benefit from a U.S.-based divestment campaign, as such a campaign will dis­proportionately target the companies that do trade on Ameri­can exchanges. In addition, seven out of these 25 are state-controlled entities, and would be unlikely to suffer from a divestment campaign, given that their primary or controlling backer also has the power to levy taxes. In fact, such entities may benefit from a successful divestment campaign, as they would be able to acquire assets from their shrinking capitalist competitors. This fact opens up another set of issues surround­ing national security and energy.\u000aAny divestment campaign would naturally damage those companies with more individual, private shareholders, and thus benefit the competing state-run entities. This could become problematic from a national security perspective, as it would shift control of the global energy market into the hands of nations like Russia, China, Brazil, Venezuela and several Middle Eastern nations, all of whom already have a strong presence in this market.\u000aGoing \u201cgreen\u201d is also not a solution to this issue, as the campaign calls for immediate action, and even with the hypo­thetically substantial infusions of capital, the technology can­not improve quickly enough to be ready to immediately take over all energy duties from fossil fuels, and nor can our truck­ing-based infrastructure and predominantly coal- and natural gas-powered electrical systems be replaced overnight.\u000aDevising an alternative solution to divestment is no easy task. However, it seems that 350.org\u2019s campaign is based off of the belief that these energy companies are unwilling to change their operations in any way, shape or form. In their FAQs, 350. org claims that \u201cExxon could still make a profit as an energy company if it transitioned its massive wealth and expertise over to renewables, but they\u2019ll do it because of government regulation, not because they willingly decide to make the move.\u201d This notion defies common sense. Energy companies like Exxon are motivated by profit, and will respond to mar­ket pressures much more positively than to politically vindic­tive regulation. Public opinion determines where the money flows, and private companies follow the cash. It comes as no surprise that most of the predominantly Western, private en­ergy companies have all dedicated some portion of their press materials to alternative energy. For example, Chevron says in the \u201cglobal issues\u201d section of its website: \u201cChevron is taking a pragmatic approach to renewable energy\u2014pursuing and focus­ing on technologies that leverage our strengths. These include geothermal, advanced biofuels, solar and energy efficiency technologies.\u201d Even if these statements are viewed cynically, the fact that these companies have made an effort to respond to public opinion and are making an effort to comply with these wishes is encouraging. Attacking these companies and indi­rectly helping the state-run enterprises and oil-states that have no such incentive to change seems counterproductive. Instead, it would be more productive to raise public awareness about climate issues, but more importantly help individuals identify what can be done to promote change on a personal and local level.\u000aHelping individual investors identify financially promis­ing alternative energy companies is one such project. Another method is promoting environmentally sustainable alternatives for use at the corporate level or in local and state government. Sustainability is gaining ground in public opinion, and pushing for awareness of concrete solutions, as opposed to concepts, will help sustainable solutions become more financially vi­able, and subsequently more widespread. Positive grassroots campaigns that create public and market pressures in favor of environmentally friendly solutions and companies are much more likely to produce the changes desired than a divestment campaign, and without the added issues of creating conflicts of interest between financial and moral concerns, as well as avoiding global economic and security concerns.\u000aShare this:Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)MoreClick to print (Opens in new window)Click to share on Pinterest (Opens in new window)Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)Click to share on Google+ (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Tags: Colin Spence Divestment Divestment campaignCategories: Opinion

aS'A Wise rethinking'
p1290
aVA few weeks ago, Tim Wise came to Pomona College amongst much fanfare (not to mention the unanimous support of every student government in the 5Cs) to discuss race issues in the United States. His talk covered his theory of white domination in the U.S., and how affirmative action can help counteract this past by increasing diversity in the upper levels of society.\u000aI strongly support the idea that we need to increase dialogue between races to understand the perceptions and experiences of each group of people. By choosing to either ignore the experiences of others or blissfully surrounding oneself with the views of one\u2019s own race, one supports a culture of hostility and misunderstanding between peoples. That being said, there are a few places where I feel Wise could improve his argument.\u000aWise claimed that affirmative action was fair because \u201cwhite folks have twelve years of affirmative action\u201d under their belts by the time they reach college. Wise is obviously pointing here to the disparity in the quality of K-12 education received by different races. What is interesting, though, is that he did not make any mention of a program for improving K-12 education in low-income areas. Would it not be simpler to cut the proverbial Gordian knot and remove the need for affirmative action by improving K-12 education in low-income areas? Although it would take some time and a considerable amount of resources, the effects of improving the education of kids in poorly performing schools would remove the need for affirmative action and allow college admissions to be race blind and fair at the same time (because everyone would roughly have the same education). The need for improved K-12 education has been underlined by research done by Richard H. Sander and Stuart Taylor Jr. (found in their book Mismatch) that followed various students who went to university through affirmative action only to drop their desired major (usually in the STEM fields) because their K-12 education did not adequately prepare them for university. For example, Sander and Taylor talked with a black Dartmouth grad who said \u201cpeople in my class had had science since grammar school, but I wasn\u2019t even introduced to science until my sophomore year of high school\u2026 I had never developed the skills I needed to achieve.\u201d Consequently, she changed from a STEM major to a humanities major. In addition, they compiled data that showed that black students at Ivy League schools are half as likely to finish a STEM major compared to whites, even though black students are slightly more likely to aspire to be a STEM major.\u000aOn a different, yet related, note, Wise could adjust how he frames his argument to take into account the experiences of low-income whites. Recently, there has been some noteworthy academic literature that shows a distinct similarity in the social problems of lower income whites and those of black and Hispanic minorities. For example, in his book Coming Apart: The State of White America 1960-2010, Charles Murray studies the effects of the growing social and cultural divide between white classes. In addition to discussing how the upper class of whites have gained a large majority of the monetary and intellectual wealth in the US, Murray explains how the lower class of whites have, since the 1960\u2019s, been facing oppressive social problems that are usually associated with black and Hispanic neighborhoods. Specifically, Murray uses Fishtown, a statistical construct, to show how the white lower class, like other low-income minorities, have been plagued by problems such as high crime, lower levels of education, illegitimacy, and joblessness.\u000aIn light of this research, the fact that Wise does not address this data is noteworthy. Unlike minorities, whites cannot use affirmative action as a social ladder, even if they come from a low-income neighborhood with dismal education, job, and life prospects. Because of this, Wise should acknowledge the greyness of social inequality by acknowledging the existence of different classes in each race thereby preventing the alienation of potential supporters of his cause.\u000aAll in all, although Wise\u2019s argument in favor of increasing dialogue between races is sound, but by focusing on affirmative action as the sole catalyst of social equality he fails to address the root of the problem, namely disparity in K-12 education between upper and lower income neighborhoods. By improving K-12 education for lower income students of every race, we could remove the need to use affirmative action as a corrective force for educational inequality. Moreover, we could better prepare those lower income students with great aspirations to reach their academic goals. Although Wise is quite a controversial figure, this, I believe, is a solution that we could all agree on.\u000aShare this:Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)MoreClick to print (Opens in new window)Click to share on Pinterest (Opens in new window)Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)Click to share on Google+ (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Tags: Martin Sartorius Tim WiseCategories: Opinion

aS'Update: Open letter to President Gann'
p1294
aVOn Mar. 1, Editors-in-Chief of the Forum, the Claremont Port Side, The Student Life, and the Claremont Independent published and delivered an open letter to President Pamela Gann regarding the new student media policy that has gone into effect this school year. The response we received was, quite frankly, lukewarm. Though she acknowledged our concerns, President Gann did not indicate any plans to change the media policy\u2019s status quo and instructed us to continue working with the Office of Public Affairs.\u000aOvershadowed by the buzz over \u201cThe Pai Memo\u201d and onslaught of articles praising and criticizing CMC\u2019s social scene, President Gann\u2019s disappointing response to our open letter has been largely overlooked. But this is an issue ultimately more important than any school\u2019s party scene. Though it is a Claremont McKenna policy, it impedes student publications from any of the 5Cs from gaining access to and interviews from CMC administrators without jumping hoops through the Office of Public Affairs. Given the interconnectedness of our consortium, one school\u2019s restrictive media policy affects students from all schools\u2019 ability to be informed about fundamental policies and structures that impact student life.\u000aWe should not be content with President Gann\u2019s response. Our letter outlined our publications\u2019 and the Office of Pubic Affairs\u2019 pre-existing efforts to work with each other and why even those efforts, under such a restrictive policy, prevented timely, reliable exchanges of information. What\u2019s more, Gann\u2019s response does not address the fundamental problem of having a public relations office be the mediator between all administrative offices and staff and student media. Publications will come and go, but students will always deserve information relevant to their academic successes, job prospects, and personal lives from punctual, fair sources.The new student media policy prevents student publications from fulfilling this requirement.\u000aChanging the policy will be a continuing imperative for the Independent in the next year. Although our publication\u2019s leadership will change, its commitment to upholding integrity and transparency on all 5Cs will continue. It is my hope that we will see this policy changed by the time I graduate next year, even if we are not able to change it under my term as Editor-in-Chief.\u000aShare this:Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)MoreClick to print (Opens in new window)Click to share on Pinterest (Opens in new window)Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)Click to share on Google+ (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Tags: Editorial Marina Giloi Media Policy Office of Public Affairs Open LetterCategories: Editorial

aS'An interview with Professor Norman Valencia'
p1298
aVThe Claremont Independent is pleased to introduce Professor Norman Valencia to Claremont McKenna College.\u000aProfessor Valencia joins us next fall as CMC\u2019s first full-time, tenure-track assistant professor of Portuguese. We had the opportunity to interview him about his academic background, research interests, the courses he will teach at CMC, and more.\u000aFor more information about Professor Valencia and the role he will play at CMC, read our previous coverage of CMC\u2019s new Portuguese program.\u000aPlease join us in welcoming Professor Valencia to our community!\u000a \u000aTell us a little bit about yourself. What is your academic background in Portuguese, and what sparked your interest in the language and in Brazilian literature?\u000aI am Colombian, and I have always been in love with literature and literary studies. Because of this, I did a Literature Major in my native Bogotá. After this, I finished a Master\u2019s in Humanities and Social Thought at NYU, and a Ph.D. in Spanish and Portuguese at Yale. Since my undergrad years, I discovered that Brazil had an amazing cultural production, especially in terms of literature. I started to read some Brazilian poets in translation (Manuel Bandeira, Carlos Drummond de Andrade, João Cabral de Melo Neto) and I soon realized that I needed to learn the language to really get to know them. Throughout my Ph.D., I went to Brazil every time I could, especially in the summers, to learn Portuguese and to do some research. There, the beauty of cities like Rio de Janeiro, Ouro Preto and São Paulo moved me to consider Brazil as a major focus of my research and my academic life.\u000aWhat drew you to Claremont McKenna College?\u000aI can answer this with a short anecdote: when I was coming to CMC for my campus visit, I had a layover at the Houston airport. A gentleman at a desk asked me why I was headed to Ontario, California. I told him I had to give a talk at CMC, and his answer was: \u201cWell, then you must be a very smart man\u2026 That is an excellent college!\u201d This just confirmed that Claremont McKenna is an extremely well-known school throughout the US. The college\u2019s students are also known for being extremely driven, which is a professor\u2019s dream. Finally, it was very exciting to see that the department of Modern Languages and Literatures needed someone to start a Portuguese program. I saw this as a very appealing challenge, something I would really like to undertake.\u000aWe understand that your focus at CMC, both in language and in literature, will be on Brazil. What does this mean for your language and literature classes? \u000aPortuguese is spoken in four continents, and this means it has a number of varieties. In my language classes, I will focus on the Brazilian variety of Portuguese, although I will try to include some of the differences between American and European Portuguese. In terms of literature, my main focus will be not only on Brazil, but on the relationships between Brazil and the rest of Latin America. For a number of reasons (historical, linguistic, political), the academic field has not produced many comparative approaches between these two traditions. I really think this needs to change; today, thinking about Latin America without including Brazil is like thinking about Asia without considering China.\u000aWhy would you recommend that CMC students enroll in Portuguese?\u000aPortuguese today is spoken by an estimated 230 million people in very different parts of the world, making it a truly global language.  Brazil is the 5th largest country in the world (both in terms of size and of population), and it has become an emerging economic and political powerhouse. It is one of the BRIC countries (Brazil, Russia, India and China) which, according to several economists, could become dominant world economies by the year 2050. As I mentioned, it is also a very culturally rich country, with outstanding contributions in the fields of literature, plastic arts, music, architecture, and film. Oh, and if you are a sports fan, it is very strong in soccer, basketball and volleyball, and it will be the host of the next soccer World Cup (2014) and the next Olympic Games (2016). In the coming years, Brazil will be at the center of the world stage for a number of reasons, so it is really a great moment to get to know its language and culture.\u000aAnything else you\u2019d like to share with us?\u000aAn academic\u2019s research is usually driven by hidden, personal reasons. For me, my interest in Brazil was also driven by my love of its music. Not only is it extremely rich, harmonically and rhythmically speaking, but it also has a number of amazing singers and songwriters, like João Gilberto, Antonio Carlos Jobim, Chico Buarque, Caetano Veloso, Maria Rita, Marisa Monte, Adriana Calcanhotto, and the list goes on. I am an amateur guitar player, and for the last couple of years I\u2019ve decided to try to learn a few songs. It has been really hard (so many complex chords!), but I already have a small repertoire\u2026 I will try to bring my guitar to class a couple of times in order to share a bit of Brazilian music with my students, and teach them some vocabulary and grammar in the process.\u000a \u000aShare this:Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)MoreClick to print (Opens in new window)Click to share on Pinterest (Opens in new window)Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)Click to share on Google+ (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Tags: Amelia Evrigenis Norman Valencia PortugueseCategories: Campus News

aS'The poison of Tinder'
p1302
aVThe iPhone application \u201cgame\u201d Tinder, bluntly put, is a socially acceptable flirting crutch to meet other people across the 5Cs, in the Claremont area, and within a desired mile radius. In order to become a \u201cplayer,\u201d users form Tinder accounts through their Facebook profiles by selecting the gender with which they would like to be \u201cmatched\u201d and setting a radius of up to 100 miles to confine the area they interact with. In addition, players insert up to four pictures for their counterparts to skim through, and the Facebook setting is advantageous in that it shows how many mutual friends Tinder users have in common. Then the game begins as profile pictures of other Tinder players pop up on the application. By mindlessly swiping the photo left (\u201cnot\u201d) or right (\u201chot\u201d), Tinder users are being trained to mindlessly rate people based solely on appearance. If the \u201chot\u201d is reciprocated by both users, the two are notified and put in direct contact via Tinder\u2019s instant messaging. The idea of Tinder being portrayed as a game makes this online, virtual flirting network less harsh than it actually is.\u000aThe 2010 film The Social Network portrays the real-life event of computer genius Mark Zuckerburg as he creates a website to rate Harvard female students. Clearly, the females are not enthused as their pictures are illegally taken, and they are publicly objectified across Harvard to the audience of men. Ironically, Tinder, similar to Zuckerburg\u2019s website of objectification, is a huge success. This could potentially be because Tinder users willingly post pictures of themselves, the objectification of men and women is mutual, and there is only positive feedback as people only know when they are \u201chotted,\u201d which results in flattery. Of course we want to engage in conversation with people who find us attractive!\u000aAlthough I held negative presumptions about Tinder, I downloaded the application. Two weeks later, I created a Tinder account, which lasted for a day. Initially, I was extremely hesitant to engage in conversation with strangers and put my own picture out there. But as soon as I got over that bump, I started \u201chotting\u201d and \u201cnotting\u201d until there was no one else in my ten-mile radius to rate. Within the first two hours of using Tinder, I was hooked\u2013constantly checking on my account and waiting for feedback from male Tinder users. At the end of the day, I reluctantly quit the Tinder app before becoming too addicted.\u000aConstantly staring at my phone screen and making rash decisions as to whom I wanted to know better shifted my mentality to the point where \u201chotting\u201d and \u201cnotting\u201d a person became second nature. Tinder is a poison, shifting outlooks, encouraging us to objectify ourselves, stripping us of valid social skills on a large campus, and confining our minds to one of two decisions\u2014\u201chot\u201d or not.\u201d\u000aShare this:Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)MoreClick to print (Opens in new window)Click to share on Pinterest (Opens in new window)Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)Click to share on Google+ (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Tags: Becky Shin TinderCategories: Opinion

aS'Why not just CMCers should care about sexual violence policy'
p1306
aVOn Mar. 1, we attended the \u201c5C Deans of Student Life Panel on Sexual Assault Policies,\u201d hosted by the Motley and Sexual Assault Awareness and Resource Committee, both student organizations at Scripps. Five deans from each Claremont College were present for the 2 hour presentation, which consisted of the deans\u2019 answers to pre-screened questions and a brief, live Q&A period.\u000aIt was an overdue opportunity for administration to engage students directly for a discussion of changes to sexual assault policies across the 5Cs. The discussion covered many questions ranging from \u201cWhat do you intend to address in the policies?\u201d to the concern that \u201cprevious policies didn\u2019t address all [sexual] identities.\u201d\u000aMore insightful, however, were the deans of the other colleges\u2019 answers in relation to those of Dean Mary Spellman, Title IX Coordinator and effective spokesperson for CMC\u2019s changes to sexual violence grievance procedures in light of the Dear Colleague Letter. Dean Spellman pointed out that CMC\u2019s sexual violence grievance procedure policy was already \u201ctechnically in compliance\u201d before the recent changes. However, it became clear from the discussion that the other\u000adeans were taking a strong lead from Spellman\u2019s initiatives.\u000aFor example, Harvey Mudd College VP of Student Affairs and Dean of Students, Maggie Browning, said that Harvey Mudd is in the process of revising its grievance procedures after they \u201ctook a look at what Dean Spellman was doing.\u201d\u000aHarvey Mudd College and Claremont McKenna College have already finalized the changes to their sexual violence grievance procedures. However, the other three colleges in the Consortium are still in the process of revising their policies.\u000aMost of the deans emphasized that cross-campus policies were of particular importance, and it seems that policies are shifting to require that grievance procedures be carried out on the respondent\u2019s campus. Given the frequency that students interact with one another across the 5Cs, the changes to grievance procedure policies on any of the five campuses have implications for any student at the Claremont Colleges.\u000aDean of Students at Scripps, Bekki Lee, acknowledged, \u201cin cross-campus cases, the learning curve is to know each other\u2019s processes.\u201d It is concerning that any type of learning curve is involved in the context of serious accusations. Such comments point to the need for students from all 5Cs to educate themselves on changes to grievance procedure policies and their accompanying implications, especially in the area of the 5Cs\u2019 differing definitions of consent and incapacitation. For example, CMC\u2019s rules explicitly state that an individual can give consent under the influence, while other Claremont Colleges consider intoxication prohibitive of consent.\u000aAccording to Dean Spellman, \u201ceach institution has its own culture of how to conduct processes. But what is really important is that where we do intersect, we have to be in agreement.\u201d\u000aThe burden is now on students to educate themselves on how and where 5C policies intersect and agree. This starts with the sweeping changes to CMC\u2019s sexual violence grievance procedures, and their problems, something to which we have already dedicated several articles, and something from which several 5C deans say they are taking the lead.\u000aShare this:Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)MoreClick to print (Opens in new window)Click to share on Pinterest (Opens in new window)Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)Click to share on Google+ (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Tags: Dean Spellman Dear Colleague Letter Marina Giloi Motley Sexual Violence Title IXCategories: Campus News Opinion

aS'Warning: Do Not Criticize'
p1310
aVOn February 28, the Harvard Crimson released an ar­ticle advising people who may want to \u201cinsult\u201d Harvard to \u201cneither apply, enroll, nor graduate\u201d from the institution. The article, aptly titled \u201cWarning: Do Not Enroll,\u201d admonished members of the political right who criticized the university\u2019s liberal leaning as simply attempting \u201cto curry favor with the more anti-intellectual members of our body politic.\u201d In par­ticular, it rebuked conservative figures such as Mitt Romney, Bill O\u2019Reilly, and Ted Cruz for criticizing Harvard for being too liberal after having attended the university.\u000aThe article is bold, commanding, and clear. It also, how­ever, goes too far.\u000aLet me begin by saying that I understand the sentiments of the Crimson. Should alumni of Claremont McKenna Col­lege begin to \u201cinsult\u201d or criticize my institution in a manner with which I disagree, I would be fairly irked. I love my col­lege and the intellectual development I am privileged to take part in; I am fairly certain that the Crimson staff writers feel the same way towards Harvard.\u000aIn depicting and reproaching would-be critics of the institution as \u201canti-intellectual,\u201d however, the Crimson may be sending a message eerily familiar to hyper-conservative groups. For example, the Facebook group \u201cIf you don\u2019t like America then please don\u2019t live here\u201d declares, \u201cComplaining about my country? Feel free to leave then!! \u2026 If you don\u2019t like it, feel free to leave!\u201d The group\u2019s mission, moreover, is \u201cTo keep people who hate on this great country, of Yours and Mine, OUT OF IT!\u201d Indeed, we are all familiar, to some degree, with impassioned demands of that nature.\u000aWe find such calls objectionable because they run coun­ter the principles of free expression that support healthy demo­cratic deliberation. Criticism does not merely serve as indica­tor of disapproval, but as a marker for improvement. As James Baldwin once remarked, \u201cI love America more than any other country in this world, and, exactly for this reason, I insist on the right to criticize her perpetually.\u201d As citizens, we should thus remain wary of requests for critics to leave the country.\u000aAs students, moreover, we should remain equally wary of requests for potential critics to desist from attending a cer­tain academic institution.\u000aShould we fail \u2013 should we become subservient to our passions as opposed to our reason \u2013 we may find ourselves in the tragic predicament where freedom of expression is main­tained so long as students subscribe to the dominant perspec­tive. We may no longer find ourselves reading articles titled, \u201cWarning: Do Not Enroll,\u201d but instead reading ones labeled, \u201cWarning: Do Not Criticize.\u201d\u000aAll of that being said, I do believe there is an alternative to urging would-be critics to desist from attending an academic institution: publically evaluating the veracity of criticisms.\u000aI assure everyone that this is not a fairly revolutionary idea. In fact, this is actually what happens all the time with student magazines and newspapers. Should a person make an argument that members of an institution find to be distasteful or flawed, another person can make an argument in response and leave it in a student publication. I, for one, find this ap­proach a tad bit more appealing than the one recently adopted by the Crimson. In fact, my belief in such an approach served as the basis my decision to write this article in the first place.\u000aI believe that this approach is beneficial for academic institutions in two regards. First, it supplements the intellec­tual development of students by forcing them to respond ef­fectively to the opinions of others in a reasoned and respectful manner. Such intellectual development thus allows students to gain new perspectives from others.\u000aSecond, it fosters a sense of inclusivity within the student body by demonstrating that it is, in fact, okay \u2013 nay, praisewor­thy \u2013 to disagree with the dominant perspective at times so long as one has a sound argument.\u000aWhile the Crimson\u2019s sentiments are understandable, the message espoused by the article seems counterproductive. In­stead of seeking to dissuade potential students from attending one\u2019s university, current students should encourage the student body to evaluate the merits of a claim.\u000aBut it\u2019s okay if you disagree. I\u2019m open to criticism.\u000aShare this:Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)MoreClick to print (Opens in new window)Click to share on Pinterest (Opens in new window)Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)Click to share on Google+ (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Tags: Do Not Criticize Do Not Enroll Harvard Crimson Nadeem FarooqiCategories: Opinion

aS'Rand Paul pushes libertarian agenda'
p1314
aVAfter a devastating loss in the November presidential election, it\u2019s no surprise that Republicans are playing the blame game.\u000aAt the March 14-16 Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) in Washington D.C., tensions between the different factions of the Republican Party became bitterly clear, most notably in the confrontations between Senator Rand Paul and the GOP establishment.\u000a\u201cThe GOP of old has grown stale and moss-covered,\u201d the Kentucky Republican said at CPAC. \u201cOur party is encumbered by an inconsistent approach to freedom. The new GOP will need to embrace liberty in both the economic and the personal sphere. If we\u2019re going to have a Republican Party that can win, liberty needs to be the backbone of the GOP.\u201d\u000aTraditional conservatives haven\u2019t hesitated to parry the thrusts of Paul and his fellow libertarian Republicans. Arizona Senator John McCain was quick to brush off Paul\u2019s recent Senate filibuster, which held up the nomination of John Brennan as CIA Director over the Obama administration\u2019s drone policy.\u000a\u201cThe country needs more Senators who care about liberty,\u201d McCain said, quoting The Wall Street Journal. \u201cBut if Mr. Paul wants to be taken seriously, he needs to do more than pull political stunts that fire up impressionable libertarian kids in their college dorms. He needs to know what he is talking about.\u201d\u000aThere have long been philosophical, ideological and policy tensions between the three main wings of the GOP\u2014neoconservatives, social conservatives and libertarians. CMC Associate Professor of Government Jon Shields believes these factions have been in constant competition for control of the party for several decades.\u000a\u201cIn a way, these tensions have always existed in the [modern] Republican Party because the party is built around these different factions that don\u2019t share common philosophical grounds and objectives,\u201d Shields said. \u201cOne of the big challenges of the party is keeping all of the various parts happy, which is a very difficult undertaking.\u201d\u000aThis enduring tension within the GOP\u2014between an interventionist foreign policy (one that abhors appeasing tyrants abroad) and the libertarian preference for a more defensive policy (one that abhors entangling military expeditions)\u2014predictably grows when triggering events occur. Professor Shields points to the Afghan and Iraqi Wars as a recent trigger in the current feud between neoconservatives and libertarians for control of the GOP.\u000a\u201cIn the Bush years, you really saw the ascendance of foreign policy hawks in his administration, and the libertarians really disliked that\u2014that was big government par excellence,\u201d Shields said. \u201cWhen the war went badly, it helped those in the party who wanted to reduce the size of government, so now they have more leverage than they once did, and neoconservatives are in a tough spot.\u201d\u000aHowever, Shields warns against libertarians overreaching while they have popular support.\u000a\u201cLet\u2019s fight Obamacare, let\u2019s not let this Leviathan get any larger\u2014I think [libertarians] can generate some political sympathy for that,\u201d Shields said. \u201cBut they can\u2019t seriously talk about getting rid of social security or Medicare\u2014that goes nowhere fast. I think their best hope is to try to limit government, cut taxes, reduce the size somewhat and reform entitlements that make them more sustainable.\u201d\u000aWhile libertarians appear to have the momentary upper hand, alienating the other wings of the party\u2014as Paul has done\u2014is certainly not in the party\u2019s best long-term interest. Rather, if Republicans want a legitimate shot at winning in 2016, they need to find a way to unite each group under the GOP banner.\u000aRepublicans need look no farther than 1980 to find the recipe for success. Ronald Reagan successfully appealed to libertarians with his fiscal policies, to neoconservatives with his defense and foreign policies, and to social conservatives with his perspectives on social issues and a restrained judiciary. Reagan famously described the \u201cEleventh Commandment\u201d: \u201cThou shalt not speak ill of any fellow Republican.\u201d Perhaps that is a nice place to start as the GOP considers its future.\u000aShare this:Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)MoreClick to print (Opens in new window)Click to share on Pinterest (Opens in new window)Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)Click to share on Google+ (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Tags: Brad Richardson GOP Jon Shields Libertarian Rand PaulCategories: Feature

aS'CMC hires assistant professor of Portuguese'
p1318
aVClaremont McKenna College recently hired its first full-time, tenure-track assistant professor of Portuguese to the Department of Modern Languages.\u000aProfessor Norman Valencia holds a Ph.D. in both Portuguese and Spanish from Yale University, where he wrote a dissertation on patriarchy and power in the Latin American novel. He has published several articles about Latin American literature and co-edited a book of essays on the topic of Brazil. He currently serves as the Academic Subdirector of the Instituto Caro y Cuervo in Bogotá, Colombia.\u000aProfessor Lee Skinner, Associate Professor of Spanish at CMC, explained that the decision to hire a professor of Portuguese manifested from the growing relevance of Brazil in international affairs. She said, \u201cThe decision to add a professor of Portuguese came about because there was interest and recognition from a lot of people that Brazil is an increasingly important area of focus and that CMC should offer students the opportunity to study Portuguese and to take content courses on Brazil as well. Brazil is the largest country in Latin America and the fifth-largest country in the world; it is a very important trading partner for the United States; and more immediately, it will host the 2014 World Cup in soccer and the 2016 Olympic Games.\u201d\u000aShe explained that although CMC and Scripps have previously offered occasional courses in introductory Portuguese, \u201chaving a full-time, tenure-track assistant professor of Portuguese and Spanish allows us to systematically build a Portuguese program for CMC and the 5Cs. So the Department of Modern Languages and Literatures proposed to the administration that we begin teaching Portuguese and that we hire a tenure-track assistant professor.\u201d\u000aThe History Department has also hired a professor of Latin American history who specializes in Brazil for similar reasons. Both the History and Modern Languages Departments received a grant from the Mellon Foundation for the Humani- ties to fund the first three years of the respective positions.\u000aProfessor Valencia will teach both Portuguese and Spanish classes at CMC. The program will begin next fall with PORT 22 (Accelerated Intensive Portuguese) for students who have already studied another Romance language (Spanish, French, or Italian). In spring 2014, Valencia will teach PORT 33 (Intermediate Portuguese). As the program grows, the Modern Languages Department will add upper-division courses as well as introductory Portuguese for students with no previous experience in another Romance language.\u000aProfessor Skinner concluded by saying, \u201cThis is really a great opportunity for CMC and the Claremont Colleges and we\u2019re delighted to welcome Prof. Valencia to our community.\u201d\u000aLook out for an interview with Professor Norman Valencia himself, to be published to claremontindependent.com in the near future.\u000aShare this:Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)MoreClick to print (Opens in new window)Click to share on Pinterest (Opens in new window)Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)Click to share on Google+ (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Tags: Amelia Evrigenis Lee Skinner Norman Valencia PortugueseCategories: Campus News

aS'Featured Organization: Students for Syria'
p1322
aVBy: Chris Gaarder and Derek Ko\u000aSeventy thousand dead. Untold hundreds of thousands wounded. Millions displaced. These are the numbers behind the two-year old Syrian crisis. Though the figures are but sanitized stand-ins for real-world horrors, they have understandably concerned a great number of people. Among those moved by the crisis are Melissa Carlson CMC \u201813 and Sara Birkenthal CMC \u201913 who, on the suggestion of CMC International Relations Professor Ed Haley, founded Students for Syria in February 2013. The group has two primary goals. First, Students for Syria hopes to, as Carlson said in an interview with the CI, make a \u201cmore human connection\u201d between the Syrian conflict and 5C students. Second, as stated in their petition, they hope to put pressure on \u201cPresident Obama and the United States Congress to stop the killing and help Syrians attain self-determination.\u000aIn pursuit of their first goal, Students for Syria is launching a 5C campaign that includes a Facebook page, an upcoming poster campaign, an informational video and various campus events. The students\u2019 campus campaign is meant to, as Carlson put it, \u201cmake noise\u201d so people are compelled to confront the serious consequences of inaction on the part of the international community.\u000aFor their second objective, Students for Syria plans a multi-pronged effort to, again, \u201cmake noise\u201d and build enough domestic pressure on Washington to make the President and Congress act. To that end, the Students for Syria has launched a petition on Change.org that currently has over 200 signatures (which notably constitutes only about a third the number that the \u201cClaremont McKenna College Administration: Take Action to Protect CMC Social Culture\u201d petition has garnered). Still, the student leaders of the organization have big plans for the future, including expanding to other universities in California. Carlson also mentioned a Students for Syria delegation to Washington D.C. as a possibility in the more distant future. There, they would hope to meet with leaders of nonprofit organizations, congressional leaders and representatives from the Obama Administration to make the case for Washington to give greater weight to the Syrian crisis.\u000aHowever, the fledgling student organization has already run into a few roadblocks. Budgetary constraints aside, they were recently forced to change a line in their petition calling for \u201cmilitary force if necessary\u201d because of the controversy and complexity U.S. intervention would entail. American war-wariness is understandable, especially following long and drawn-out interventions in Afghanistan and Iraq that have not yielded clear-cut victories in the eyes of the American public. Students for Syria felt that the backlash from specifying armed intervention as an option would only distract from their objective of ending the Syrian crisis. The organization now makes it quite clear they are simply calling for international action to end the bloodshed and not taking a specific position on what type of support should be given. Putting the issue of armed intervention (or lack thereof) aside, there still remains a serious division in foreign policy circles over the best long-term strategy in addressing the Syrian crisis.\u000aFor expert opinions on the subject, we interviewed Professor Haley and fellow CMC International Relations Professor Jennifer Taw. Although they both agreed that breaking the Assad regime and producing a negotiated settlement was imperative, they had very different perspectives on how the U.S. should approach the situation.\u000aHaley specifically advocates for U.S. aid to Syrian rebel groups that best represent Western interests and could be trusted most to bring Syria through a democratic transition without initiating a mass-scale retaliation against the ruling minority. He points out that the Iran and Russia are already propping up the Assad regime, while Saudi Arabia and the Gulf States are sending aid to various groups in the opposition. Britain and France appear likely to send aid to their favorite rebel groups in short order. Meanwhile, the U.S. has largely kept out of the crisis. If the U.S. does not sponsor a rebel faction, Haley does not think it will have the \u201cpersuasive voice\u201d that other international actors would have gained by the time the regime crumbles or is brought to the table to begin negotiations.\u000aIn addition to the importance of enhancing the influence of America among rebel groups through aid, Haley emphasizes that time is a crucial consideration. Unfortunately, according to Haley, \u201cthe longer it goes on, the worse it becomes for U.S. interests.\u201d  The longer the crisis continues, the more who will be killed, wounded, displaced, or otherwise harmed. A longer crisis will only develop deeper divides within Syrian society, and more fixed hostilities. Moreover, the victory of either of the Islamists backed by Saudi Arabia or the current regime backed by Iran and Russia would not serve U.S. interests or humanitarian concerns particularly well.\u000aTaw agrees that a negotiated agreement between all involved parties is ultimately the preferable solution to the crisis, but is careful to note that if not done properly, bringing a quick end to the current conflict could simply set the stage for  \u201ca new, and prolonged second act in which blood continues to flow, jihadists rise to the fore, and the region as a whole splits as it splits within Syria.\u000aFor Taw, even the idea that the U.S. could force the international community to act is doubtful. Already, \u201cThe U.S. can\u2019t even prevent other countries from arming and otherwise supporting the regime,\u201d and if a U.S. proxy were to succeed in the short term by way of force, \u201csuch an effort would undoubtedly be followed by a set of ongoing insurgencies similar to Iraq\u2019s.\u201d Taw is also skeptical about the notion that there are rebel groups that the U.S. can in fact trust in the long term. In other words, Taw views the U.S. capacity to influence the conflict in a positive direction as fundamentally limited.\u000aThe situation in Syria is by all accounts a tragedy. There are no easy solutions or clear historical blueprints to follow. In the post-Cold War era, we have seen successful cases of international intervention (Bosnia), cases where many argue we should have had international intervention but did nothing (Rwanda) and cases where the West did intervene, with at best, mixed results (Somalia, Afghanistan and Iraq). Will the U.S. take action beyond providing humanitarian aid? That remains to be seen. Can we, successfully? That remains an open question.\u000aHowever, one thing is certain: whether U.S. intervention would be a soaring success, a complete disaster, or some murky mix of the two, time is rapidly running out for the Syrian people. It is about time that American policy-makers and students alike begin serious, public discussion on about the crisis.  Whether one is a supporter of U.S. action or a staunch non-interventionist, Students for Syria is a force worthy of attention.\u000aShare this:Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)MoreClick to print (Opens in new window)Click to share on Pinterest (Opens in new window)Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)Click to share on Google+ (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Tags: Chris Gaarder CMC Derek Ko Edward Haley Jennifer Taw Students for Syria SyriaCategories: Campus News Feature Featured Organizations

p1326
aVThe following opinion piece is written as a guest contribution to the Claremont Independent.\u000aLast month marked two years since my admittance to Claremont McKenna College. I remember the overwhelming sense of accomplishment and anticipation I felt as I signed and returned my acceptance letter. I had joined the ranks of an elite group of extremely talented students and gained access to an incredible alumni network. I had every opportunity in front of me, all thanks to CMC.\u000aPart of my excitement was that all of my future class would begin with a clean slate. The barriers and cliques of high school had been leveled. It didn\u2019t matter whether we were from a private school or public school, AP or IB program, American or international students. We were all CMCers now; individual work ethic and character would define us from that day on.\u000aOf course, I soon found that these feelings, though well-founded in principle, were naïve and incomplete. There are other factors beyond merit that affect achievement. At such a small campus, it soon became clear that \u201cwho you know\u201d and reputation is a large advantage when competing within the CMC bubble. I soon learned that a minor degree of cronyism is a fact of life and social outreach is a means to success. While it is not true meritocracy, I like to believe that these opportunities are available to all and correlate with effort.\u000aBut my concern is not networking; my concern is its exploitation. Before Spring Break, the ASCMC Elections Committee was forced to ask former ASCMC President and Vice President to remove themselves from deliberation on the new Executive Board appointments and restart the appointment process. While we do not have all the facts, it has come to light that membership in a \u201cprivate organization\u201d significantly skewed the former officers\u2019 decision-making. Since then, we have had underwhelming journalistic coverage (aside from satire) on the issue. In order for us to avoid a more calamitous ethical issue, I find it necessary to put forth a number of issues raised by this recently uncovered secret society.\u000aMy objective in this article is to first reaffirm the foundation of CMC culture and then argue that secret organizations are antithetical to it. Yes, secret societies are self-important and laughable, but they are equally threatening to CMC\u2019s culture and should not be dismissed.\u000aThe \u201cPrinces\u201d pose a serious problem for the delicate balance of our inclusive philosophy and selective on-campus organizations. It rails against our inclusive culture and delegitimizes campus leadership positions. If students suspect, or have substantial proof that, a group has underhandedly manipulated distributions of power on campus, student media has a responsibility to fully investigate and report on these unacceptable actions. In response, I believe the student body must perpetuate a culture that actively discourages further creation or reconvening of any such secret groups.\u000aWhile we can reasonably anticipate a certain degree of cronyism in on-campus selection processes, secretive and calculated motives are much different from the advantages of equal opportunity networking. Networking is fair because it is open to everyone\u2014secret societies are neither.\u000aStudents apply for the Executive Board because they believe they will be judged on the merits of their applications, their ability to work with fellow students, and possibly by who they know. But, in this case, they cannot reasonably suspect that those reading their applications will have blind allegiances to their competitors based upon subjective membership in a \u201cprivate organization.\u201d When the Elections Committee calls potential candidates, including myself and other current \u201cmembers of the corporation\u201d, to tell them what they should and should not run for in order to better maintain footholds for a sputtering old boys\u2019 club, they violate the premises of CMC. When they manufacture an Executive Board based not on merit, or even connectedness, but in accordance with secret frat membership, they pose a greater threat to our social scene than any Friday class or TNC fence.  Moreover, they remove the collaborative attitude of CMC\u2019s culture, breaking down relationships between students and replacing them with undue barriers like those found at other colleges to which I refused to apply. And the threat is not limited to the social scene: the Princes systematically threaten the career opportunities of non-members, putting themselves before others in a predetermined selection process.\u000aTwo great ironies of the past few weeks have been that (1) these actions happened at the hands of the ASCMC administration that promised transparency and reform and (2) just days after writing an open letter intended to resurrect the social scene through inclusiveness, the same individuals attempted to preserve the influence of a \u201cprivate organization\u201d through pervasive measures that are just as much of a threat to CMC culture. We need a critical eye to look past the messaging and into the inconsistencies of CMC politics.\u000aAt best, we know that a more extreme form of cronyism took place in the original Executive Board appointment process \u2014a form that violates CMC\u2019s networking-as-usual. At worst, we have found a group that challenges the fabric of CMC, a systematic virus that extends to other prominent groups on campus. In either case, these actions are intolerable. We need publications to start a discussion regarding campus culture and how to reconcile ambition and ethics. The virus must be further investigated by the student press and strongly discouraged by future CMCers.\u000aTo begin this discussion, the student body needs the complete story. Through investigation, we must find the extent of the damage and set a standard so that future campus leaders act in accordance with the opportunities guaranteed by our acceptance letters. While we move on from the transgressions of the past, we must not forget CMC\u2019s inclusive foundation and protect against the actions and groups that threaten it.\u000aShare this:Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)MoreClick to print (Opens in new window)Click to share on Pinterest (Opens in new window)Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)Click to share on Google+ (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Tags: ASCMC ASCMC Executive Board CMC cronyism Ian O'Grady PrincesCategories: Editorial Guest Opinion Opinion

aS'Zimbardo at the Athenaeum'
p1330
aV\u201cAll evil starts with 15 volts.\u201d If there was one point that the audience was supposed to remember from Dr. Phillip Zimbardo\u2019s Athenaeum speech, it was this. With this one line, Dr. Zimbardo succinctly highlighted his explanation for why people perform evil actions while also tying together a lineage of research that spans decades and regions, and includes some of psychology\u2019s most famous and notorious experiments.\u000aThe line itself refers to a series of experiments carried out in the early 1960s by Dr. Stanley Milgram at Yale. These studies, which were designed to study how ordinary individuals responded to authority, involved the subjects shocking a fictional person for answering questions incorrectly. The fictional \u201cvictim\u201d would respond with pre-recorded sounds of pain that would escalate as the shocks increased, until the last 10 levels, where the victim would fall silent and remain that way through the conclusion of the experiment. Milgram polled both senior undergraduates and fellow psychologists, and both groups predicted around one percent of the subjects would administer the maximum shock. The results revealed that both groups were extremely incorrect. Nearly 65 percent of the participants administered the maximum shock, and nearly all were clearly uncomfortable in doing so, yet did so anyway with prodding from the experimenter.\u000aThe experiment shocked the world and lent some insight into how ordinary people can come to commit massive atrocities. Dr. Zimbardo noted that it was perhaps the most notorious and controversial experiment in psychology until he conducted his own experiment, referred to now as the Stanford Prison Experiment, approximately a decade later. In Zimbardo\u2019s study, ordinary students were arbitrarily assigned to \u201cprisoner\u201d or \u201cguard\u201d roles in a jail located in the basement of Stanford\u2019s psychology department. The two-week experiment lasted only six days as the guards quickly embraced their role and became more and more authoritarian, ultimately to the point where they were psychologically abusing the prisoners. These results, like the results of the Milgram studies earlier, were shocking. Dr. Zimbardo explicitly pointed out, that these students were chosen because they were considered to be stable and healthy. In addition, Dr. Zimbardo also stated that while the actions of the \u201cguards\u201d became so extreme as to raise ethical and safety concerns, the students, both eventual \u201cguards\u201d and \u201cprisoners,\u201d had indicated a preference for the \u201cprisoner\u201d role. None of these men, he argued, were initially inclined towards the authoritarian role. This study provided substantial support for what he has termed \u201cthe Lucifer effect,\u201d which is the notion that over time, ordinary people can transform into evil individuals capable of terrible deeds, given certain circumstances.\u000aDr. Zimbardo went on to apply these lessons from his study to the case of the guards at Abu Ghraib prison, in which he testified as an expert witness. In this case, guards were accused of abusing prisoners after being left in positions of authority with morally ambiguously instruction and limited oversight. In this case, but in general as well, Zimbardo noted an inclination to blame bad behavior on an individual perpetrator\u2019s disposition, to blame the problem on a few so-called \u201cbad apples.\u201d Dr. Zimbardo went on to explain that this viewpoint contradicts what the research and the facts of the case indicate, which is that the situation, the \u201capple barrel,\u201d was the problem, and essentially drove ordinary people to become evil and commit atrocities. Zimbardo concluded that while people are still responsible for their actions, preventing future cruelty requires actually addressing the situation or the system that caused the behavioral transformation, as well as the individuals and organizations responsible for creating the system.\u000aDr. Zimbardo finished his speech by speaking on the topic of heroes. While ordinary people can become evil, Zimbardo argued they also could become heroes in the right circumstances. He stated that most heroes are just ordinary people in dire situations that respond courageously. There is a need in our society to honor and elevate people who do truly heroic things, and to de-emphasize cultural heroes like athletes and celebrities. To ultimately improve society, Dr. Zimbardo prescribed holding ourselves to a higher moral standard in all aspects of society. If we want to shift the balance to good from evil, we need to honor true heroes, pass moral laws, elect moral leaders and make a conscious effort to conduct our daily lives justly. Then perhaps the scales will shift, but not before we take responsibility and act.\u000aShare this:Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)MoreClick to print (Opens in new window)Click to share on Pinterest (Opens in new window)Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)Click to share on Google+ (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Tags: Athenaeum Colin Spence Psychology ZimbardoCategories: Campus News

aS'Sandra Fluke surprises'
p1334
aVAs someone who not only opposes public funding for birth control, but also believes in axing public funding for a wide range of government programs, I was quick to pass judgment on Sandra Fluke following her speech at the Democratic National Convention. To me, her words were painfully unoriginal, re-telling the tired feminist narrative portraying conservative men as a patriarchal oppressor class trying to \u201ccontrol women\u2019s bodies\u201d in an age when contraception was more accessible than ever. As for Ms. Fluke herself, she was the figure around which the Democratic Party opportunistically built its \u201cWar on Women\u201d narrative following a few abhorrent comments made by figures on the fringe of the GOP. She was not, in my mind, a gender egalitarian or even an advocate for the oppressed. She was simply a feminist icon, the latest front woman for the women\u2019s lobby which has favored gender-based affirmative action over meritocracy and kangaroo courts over due process for handling sexual assault cases on college campuses.\u000aIt was as I began writing my preconceptions down on paper that I realized that I had fallen into the trap of my own prejudice. Despite my constant criticism of the way libertarians are mischaracterized and misunderstood by the left and in the media, I myself was guilty of drawing a radical caricature of Sandra Fluke which could be easily judged and discredited. Meeting Ms. Fluke at the Athenaeum gave me a much-needed reminder that good people often have the same goals albeit radically different ideas on how to achieve them.\u000aThe topic of Ms. Fluke\u2019s speech was a pleasant surprise. Putting her advocacy for universal birth control funding and reproductive rights aside, she took the time to speak on a topic near and dear to her heart: America\u2019s LGBT population. She described how though there are several million LGBT employees in the private sector, only 21 states and Washington D.C. currently prohibit work discrimination against gays and lesbians by law. Fluke then shifted the attention of the attendees to the \u201cT\u201d in LGBT, explaining that even in many of the states where discrimination based on sexual orientation is prohibited, there are no protections in place for gender identity. Ms. Fluke later spoke of her support for the Employee Non-Discrimination Act (ENDA) which would replace the \u201cpatchwork\u201d of laws addressing discrimination against the LGBT community with comprehensive federal protection. Her message of equality for all in society and her special emphasis on refusing to leave transgendered Americans behind proved noncontroversial to the audience.\u000aEven during the question and answer period in which she tackled thornier issues, Ms. Fluke answered questions in a straight-forward manner and showed herself to be a pragmatic and moderate advocate. When asked about the lack of attention and help given to male domestic violence victims or the gendered language of legislation regarding human trafficking, she vehemently asserted that all victims, regardless of gender, deserve help. When questioned on the conflict between the provision of birth control and the question of religious liberty, she answered from the center, asserting that there needed to be a balance between the two. She went on to list categories of religiously-affiliated organizations which were exempt from the birth control mandate, and stated her firm commitment to the liberties of all religious communities including her own.\u000aWhat I admired most about Sandra Fluke, however, was her emphasis on free expression and the necessity of dialogue. Her anecdote about an ACLU lawyer who protested a speaker on a university campus, but stood up against fellow demonstrators when they started blocking access to the talk, showed that strongly held beliefs and a respect for open dialogue are not mutually exclusive. I personally believe that it is exactly this kind of dialogue that needs to take place more often between those on opposing ends of the political spectrum. Because Ms. Fluke dedicated over half her time to the question and answer period, this open dialogue is exactly what I and many other students present received. The talk became one of a few at the Athenaeum where few hands were left raised and few questions left unanswered.\u000aI still oppose the regulatory and bureaucratic nightmare of Obamacare (which does not currently contain a single provision on much needed tort reform). Though I believe strongly in reproductive freedom, I remain allergic to the idea of the government paying for any man or woman\u2019s personal choices. However, I have found that in many ways, liberals can be friends of the Liberty Movement and more importantly, advocates for the rights of all people. When it comes to causes like equality for LGBT members of society, prevention of human trafficking, and the upholding of First Amendment rights, I am proud and very glad to have allies on the left like Sandra Fluke.\u000aShare this:Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)MoreClick to print (Opens in new window)Click to share on Pinterest (Opens in new window)Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)Click to share on Google+ (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Tags: Athenaeum Derek Ko Feminism LGBT Sandra FlukeCategories: Campus News

aS'Computing Differently'
p1338
aVIn 2009, iPad was iPod spelled incorrectly, we only endured one Hangover, the Motorola Droid was the archaeohipster\u2019s solution to the iPhone, and a fair number from the senior class bought their first laptops, many of which are still in use today.\u000aWhile the cell phone industry pushes a 2-year lifecycle  for smartphones, the demarcation for laptops is blurrier. As the summer approaches, and a quarter of our classmates prepare to write a new chapter in  their lives, many are bound to think: \u201cShould I write it  in a literally cutting-edge  computer, like the Air or an Ultrabook? Should I get a traditional laptop? Is  there another solution?\u201d\u000aMy answer: it depends.\u000aFor users with medium-to-heavy computer usage, I am not going to offer a recommendation in this column. For the more casual user, for whom money is a concern, however, a more radical departure from the computing norm makes sense. As the technology evolved, a new option emerged in 2012, one with increased versatility, decreased cost, and improved functionality: the Tablet-Chromebook combo.\u000aWhat is a Chromebook? Think of the Chromebook as a descendant of the netbook. A Chromebook is a trimmed down laptop that runs Google\u2019s Chrome OS (a Linux-based operating system, basically an advanced Google Chrome browser). It centers around web-based applications and on- or offline document creation using Google Drive. Drive is a service that allows users to create and store documents, spreadsheets, presentations and forms. Files can be stored on the Chromebook, but Google is promoting data storage on \u201cthe Cloud,\u201d with 100 GB of space on Google Drive included. For heavy duty typing, web browsing, and presentation-creating duties, a $249 Samsung Chromebook (Amazon) fits the average user\u2019s needs. (Also a great gift for Grandma!)

In order to face another intense study schedule\u2014staring at a textbook with blood-shot eyes, unkempt hair and a growling stomach\u2014we need grub. Pomona\u2019s Coop Café? Check. CMC\u2019s Hub Store? Bustling. Pitzer\u2019s Grove House? Open. Mudd\u2019s Jay\u2019s Place? Got it. Scripps\u2019 Motley? Dark, dead, with a \u201cClosed\u201d sign hanging from the door for well over the first two weeks of this academic semester.\u000aWhen questioned about their late opening, the Motley management claims that they need to train their baristas and make a work schedule during the first weeks of the semester. (Meanwhile, the managers use the space as a personal study lounge.) Yet all the other student-run food joints on campus open early, with trained workers and a running schedule! What? Who? How does the Motley get away with this when all the other colleges\u2019 food Meccas are open and serving? The Motley permeates entitlement with its pristine location in the center of all 5-C\u2019s, freshly baked goods, good-looking baristas, and quirky atmosphere strewn with colorful breast-castings and tampons next to the register. Regardless of when the Motley officially decides to open to the public and regardless of how much we all complain about our caffeine deficiency, nobody will boycott the Motley! We are upset about their late opening because we love them so much. Boycotting the Motley would mean choosing to deprive our taste buds of an experience in addition to prolonging accessible caffeine.\u000aSure, we all have coffee machines in our cafeterias, and a few other school cafes provide us with drinks, yet we rush to the Motley after class and wait in long lines out the door. We\u2019re even willing to pay that extra dollar to have a \u201cto-go\u201d cup because the Motley is worth it. 5-C\u2019s! The Motley has a monopoly over the coffee business and we need to speak up! The rest of the Consortium\u2019s café\u2019s face market competition. They keep each other in check. Yet, why do we put up with the Motley\u2019s dawdling? In addition to their late opening, the Motley is constantly running out of supplies\u2014occasionally without the proper juice for their smoothies, without straws for their iced drinks, and without cream cheese for their bagels. I have experienced the displeasure of strawlessly sipping my \u201cto-go\u201d iced chai as I lifted the cup and was forced to avert my focus from my studies in order to avoid spilling.

aS'Beyond Dean-O-Mite: Chodosh on free speech & more'
p1346
aVOn December 7th, 2012, the Editors-in-Chief of student publications the Forum, the Claremont\u000a Port Side, and the Claremont Independent had the opportunity to interview Claremont McKenna College\u2019s new President-elect Hiram Chodosh.\u000aThe Claremont Independent had asked Chodosh some questions near and dear to our publication\u2019s heart.\u000aWe asked Chodosh if he saw himself continuing CMC\u2019s tradition of being a politically balanced campus. He replied that much of that tradition is ingrained in participating in the Athenaeum, saying that a number of campuses are not as politically balanced as they should be. Chodosh pointed out that a large part of education can take place among peers and that, if engaged, diversity of opinion is an advantage. The Athenaeum, Chodosh said, creates that forum for discourse and has a tremendous impact on campus engagement.\u000aWe also asked President-elect Chodosh about the Foundation for Individual Rights in Education\u2019s recent change in CMC\u2019s speech code rating from Red to Yellow\u2014whether this change is something that he believes is important, and what steps he plans to take to change the free speech rating as it stands. Chodosh responded that while he was new to the particular context, he believes that it is \u201cvery important that there be a strong free speech regime on college campuses.\u201d But, he noted, it is important that the freedom of one person\u2019s speech cannot impede another\u2019s. Chodosh emphasized the need to create a learning environment through the promotion of free speech. Creating a learning moment from offensive speech, entails getting together to talk about the controversies in a way that can produce a deeper understanding of the issues at hand. \u201cIt is important that each of us learn our way through these controversies.\u201d\u000aIt\u2019s a promising start for our President-elect, but we can only wait to see whether he will properly address the issues of political balance and free speech during his term.\u000aShare this:Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)MoreClick to print (Opens in new window)Click to share on Pinterest (Opens in new window)Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)Click to share on Google+ (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Tags: CMC Free Speech Hiram ChodoshCategories: Campus News

aS'Lessons from Argentina: Everything will be okay'
p1350
aVA strike significant enough to shut down the subway in the nation\u2019s largest city would worry Americans (or should I say the people of the United States, since, after all, Argentines consider themselves to be Americans as well). Yet in Buenos Aires, the magically chaotic capital city of Argentina, a major strike causing the Subte (the Buenos Aires subway) to close for six entire days provoked little concern. There, todo está bien\u2014it\u2019s all good.\u000aThis was the condition of Buenos Aires when I moved into my apartment in mid-July. As people could not get to work and students could not to get to class, the streets filled with people enjoying what seemed to be much-needed days off. The responsibility of fixing the wage conflict to get the subway workers back to work was merely a concern of the government and something its constituency did not greatly concern itself with.\u000aLiving and studying in Buenos Aires for five months completely changed my perspective on the political system of the United States. During my second week living in my home stay, as I was walking home from class one afternoon, cars started incessantly honking their horns in synchronization and people emerged from their apartment windows banging on pots and pans. Walking in the door of my apartment, my host mom handed me a pot and a wooden spoon and herded me out to the balcony of the apartment. We proceeded to laugh and scream, simultaneously banging on pots and exchanging gleeful glances with the other people in our building and on the street doing the same thing. Our building even managed to make a beat out of it, alternating which floor banged its pots when.\u000aI had participated in my first cacerolazo. In order to protest the policies of Argentine President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner, or CFK as she is commonly called, middle class Argentines refuse to listen to her speeches; instead, they bang on pots, honk their horns and scream in unison to avoid hearing what she has to say.\u000aThis form of protest struck me as extremely confusing. How can you hope to change  what President Fernandez de Kirchner is doing if you do not first know what she is implementing? How can you work with the \u201cenemy\u201d without first listening to them?\u000aWith my interest in politics, I completed my first oral presentation in my Spanish class on the presidency of Argentina, comparing it with that of President Obama. Argentina historically has had an authoritative and controlling head of state. The Argentine president can implement her own legislation in the absence of any existing technicality granting her legal authority to write legislation.\u000aThe president can issue executive documents that, on paper, sound similar to the Executive Orders of the President of the United States. These decretos de necesidad y urgenica, or DNUs as they are more commonly referred, are executive documents with the force of law for a limited period of time. An amendment to the Constitution of Argentina in 1994 legalized DNUs. As the name implies, they are to be used only in extreme circumstances, out of necesidad (necessity) and urgencia (urgency), and only when a matter is so time-sensitive that it cannot be taken through the normal route of a law through Congress. Until 2006, the President of Argentina could issue DNUs without the presence of any legislative controls. Due to modifications to this law in 2006, both chambers of the legislature, the Chamber of Deputies and the Senate, must now approve or reject any DNUs of the president within 10 days; however, during this period the DNU is enforced. More importantly, an existing exception in the law requires that any existing DNU that offers new rights to a section of the population may not be rejected or removed from the law. Additionally, the role of bribery on the part of the president often taints the legislative process. In 2008, President Fernandez de Kirchner issued a DNU to increase the size of the budget by $11.6 billion, claiming legality and validation for this DNU given the pending possibility of a financial emergency. No emergency existed, besides the lack of adequate funds left in the budget to allow for functionality of the government, yet the decree is still in place today.\u000aWhy is President Fernandez de Kirchner not held accountable for her actions? Why is no one questioning the legality of her budget increase?\u000aAs I got settled in Buenos Aires, I also quickly learned about the Central Bank of Argentina\u2019s ban on the purchase of U.S. dollars that was part of an effort led by President Fernandez de Kirchner. No matter what ATM or currency exchange place you go to, it is impossible to withdraw any form of U.S. dollar in Argentina. The government implemented the policy in order to protect its foreign reserves and pay off its growing debts in an effort to avoid addressing its rampant inflation. The only people in Argentina able to buy foreign currency must get permission from the national tax agency first and, moreover, must spend their dollars while traveling outside of Argentina. While a ban on the world\u2019s predominant currency may seem perplexing, what\u2019s even more surprising is the nonchalant attitude toward the black market that has developed since the ban. A black market for the U.S. dollar has exploded in the past six months. While the ATMS only offer $4.50 pesos for $1 USD, rates in the black market, referred to as \u201cdólar blue\u201d in Buenos Aires, have reached levels of $6.80 pesos for $1 USD. Shockingly, this illegal market is in no way hidden. Newspapers daily publish rates of the dólar blue market. Websites such as Xoom.com allow for constituents to place an order for the conversion of U.S. dollars to pesos at the black market rate, picking up the pesos at a series of unmarked buildings spread out every few miles. I would know\u2014I myself was an avid customer. Bars even post signs next to the cash registers offering reputable exchange rates of $5.25 pesos for $1 USD. The government makes no effort to combat this black market activity, and it is not concealed whatsoever.\u000aAgain, I found myself asking, \u201cWhy is this allowed?\u201d What is being done to actively fix the currency valuation problem?\u000aSix months later, I am now repeating the same phrase my host mom would use to respond to my never-ending string of political questions: tranquilo. This phrase, which directly translates to \u201cquiet\u201d or \u201ccalm\u201d has the same connotation in the Buenos Aires lunfardo (slang), as an offhanded, laid-back command of \u201cRelax!\u201d\u000aReturning to the United States, I can\u2019t help but be comforted by the Argentine acceptance of tranquilo. While every controversy in the United States political realm seems like the end of the world to politicians, the media, and engaged college students, at the end of the day the problem will most likely work itself out. In Argentina, questions regarding policy decisions and even protests go unacknowledged. It has reached such an extreme that Argentine citizens now protest merely to express their discontent, not sure of exactly where to begin. Focusing in on a single problem would simply be too narrowing.\u000aThere are problems, but the government still runs on a day-to-day basis. Buenos Aires is still one of the most beautiful cities in the world, and even one of the 10 happiest places to live in the world, according to a recent survey by Fast Company. The tranquilo response to political problems has permanently changed my mentality.  It\u2019s impossible to explain away or fix every political problem that pops up. While it\u2019s important to question decisions, at the end of the day, have faith in the system and relax. Everything will be okay. Todo está bien.\u000aShare this:Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)MoreClick to print (Opens in new window)Click to share on Pinterest (Opens in new window)Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)Click to share on Google+ (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Tags: Argentina Buenos Aires Lynsey Chediak Study AbroadCategories: Campus News

aV\u000aGun-rights advocates have often insinuated that if the government saw fit to ban firearms, it would see fit to ban knives to curb other types of violence. Though skeptical of gun control, I had always laughed off these sorts of slippery-slope scenarios as far-fetched and improbable. Last fall however, I was studying abroad in Beijing during the 18th Communist Party Congress. For the duration of the congress, a meeting of about 3000 party officials from around the country, the sale of many basic household items was banned in Beijing. These included lighter fluid (to prevent self-immolations), balloons (to prevent leaflet distribution), and yes, scissors and knives (to prevent assassination attempts and other political violence). To make matters more comical, 110,000 civilian \u201cvolunteers\u201d were recruited from around the city and paid 40RMB (7 dollars) a day to don red armbands and keep an eye out for \u201csuspicious activity.\u201d The two-week extravaganza reminded me yet again that as an American-born Libertarian, I had wandered far from home both geographically and ideologically.\u000aIt was during this trip however, that I was able to reflect on the common American perceptions of China, and how they stacked up against reality. As the world\u2019s second largest economy and a \u201crising superpower\u201d in the eyes of many Western intellectuals, China has not escaped mention by major American media outlets for a single day in recent years. But when I finally visited China for myself, I realized just how much comparative confidence I still had in the United States.\u000aThe late economist Milton Friedman had often emphasized that how people \u201cvote with their feet\u201d should not be overlooked. Reflecting upon this statement, I can only be proud of the fact that over 60,000 people from mainland China still choose to permanently immigrate to the U.S. every year. While I met several American expatriates who were working short-term in China, I did not meet a single one who had chosen to settle there permanently. If all one hears of is the overhyped Chinese \u201ceconomic miracle\u201d and the United States\u2019 economic struggles, this phenomenon should appear confusing. If one looks beneath China\u2019s thirty-year boom, however, one sees that for all the talk of China \u201csurpassing the U.S.,\u201d flaws abound in the Chinese economic model.\u000aThe lack of innovation in the Chinese economy was a constant theme in my conversations with Chinese natives. One student, an economics major at my host university commented that the United States would always be a step ahead of China because the Chinese only ever copied what the Americans did. The enormous market for counterfeit electronic goods in China seemed to affirm his statement, but the failure of China to innovate was not limited to the technology sector. When I asked my Chinese roommate to recommend Chinese television shows to me, he replied that although there were a few good ones, he watched mostly American shows. Before returning to his laptop to watch Prison Break, he joked that he found it humorous that a country of 1.4 billion people could not produce a single good show.

aS'An Open Letter to President Pamela Gann'
p1367
aV\u000aAn Open Letter to President Pamela Gann\u000aMarch 1, 2013\u000aDear President Pamela Gann,\u000aClaremont McKenna College recently instituted a new student media policy requiring student\u000ajournalists interested in contacting administrators to do so strictly through the Office of Public\u000aAffairs. The OPA may then facilitate an interview for the student, but can choose instead to\u000aprovide the requested information or a statement on the given issue, which denies the reporter\u000athe opportunity to speak directly to administrators who are most familiar with each topic.\u000aWe urge you to reconsider this policy because it undermines our ability to provide timely\u000acoverage of the issues that students care about. In hindering student journalists\u2019 access\u000ato CMC administrators, this approach to student media decreases the transparency of\u000aadministrative actions and harms the relationship between the CMC administration and the\u000astudents whom it is meant to serve.\u000aMax Benavidez, Associate Vice President for Public Affairs, and Alissa Stedman, Director of\u000aMedia Relations, outlined and discussed this policy in a February 4th meeting with editors\u000afrom the Forum, Claremont Independent, and Claremont Port Side. They said that this policy\u000ais meant to put student journalists in contact with appropriate sources and to provide them with\u000aaccurate information. External news media already operate this way, making this new policy a\u000aformalization of such practice for all media.\u000aThis policy makes sense for external media, and we appreciate the respect implied by treating\u000aour publications the same way. Yet campus publications should be treated differently. Unlike\u000aexternal media, we are familiar with CMC and its staff, and we care about stories that will never\u000abe national news. And in our attempts to adhere to the new policy by contacting administrators\u000athrough the OPA, we have found OPA staff to be slow in responding to our requests \u2013 if they\u000arespond at all. We have missed deadlines because of this policy, preventing us from keeping\u000astudents informed about the issues that affect them.\u000aWe understand the administration\u2019s desire to ensure that information published about CMC\u000ais consistent and accurate, particularly in the wake of the SAT scandal. Yet the SAT scandal\u000ademonstrated the need for more accountability, not less. Student media provide necessary\u000aexternal oversight by informing CMC students and the Claremont community about what is\u000ahappening at CMC. Yet to do so, they must have access to administrators who are free to speak\u000aopenly and candidly. The interactions between our writers and CMC administrators should not\u000abe mediated by an office explicitly devoted to public relations.\u000aCMC prides itself on its close-knit community, and rightfully so. Yet when it comes to fostering\u000aan atmosphere of mutual trust and respect, this policy is a step in the wrong direction. Trust\u000aadministrators to accurately represent CMC and its policies, and to carefully explain their\u000aown perspectives on a given issue. And trust our publications to ethically communicate those\u000aperspectives to a community of students that deserves access to information about CMC\u2019s\u000apolicies and the people who shape them.\u000aSincerely,

aS'ASCMC Elections Committee\xe2\x80\x99s Exception Yields Controversial Outcome'
p1381
aV\u000aOn Thursday, Feb. 26th, the CMC Class of 2015  elected Mohammad \u201cMoe\u201d Abdulrahim as Junior Class President.\u000aASCMC requires that class president candidates  submit 50 different  signatures from classmates. ASCMC set the signature submission deadline from 10:30 to 11:00 pm on Feb. 22nd.\u000aAbdulrahim submitted his signatures at 11:17 pm. His petition violated the ASCMC Constitution: \u201cThe Elections Committee will hold a meeting for all candidates at which time all petitions must be submitted. No petitions may be submitted after the close of this meeting\u201d (IV.B.2.b.iii).\u000aThe ASCMC Elections Committee passed a motion to accept the late signatures due to the nature of the circumstances affecting his late submission.\u000aIn an email to the Claremont Independent, an ASCMC representative stated that a \u201csudden and unexpected academic obligation\u201d delayed the submission of Abdulrahim\u2019s signatures.  The representative further stated that the signatures were late \u201cdue to factors beyond his control.\u201d Another ASCMC representative confirmed that Abdulrahim\u2019s conflict occurred between 10:30 and 11:00 pm. Abdulrahim has not responded to our request for details on the nature of his academic conflict.\u000aThe Committee\u2019s actions bring into question whether Abdulrahim\u2019s former involvement in ASCMC influenced the Elections Committee\u2019s decision to make such an exception. Abdulrahim is currently finishing his term as the ASCMC Student Life Chair; his duties include planning and executing all school-wide non-alcoholic events. The Student Life Chair also sits on the ASCMC Executive Board. Four out of the seven (a majority) members of the Elections Committee are members of the Executive Board, including the President, Vice President, and President Pro-Tempore. According the last fully available ASCMC Constitution via ascmc.org, \u201cin the event that an immediate decision regarding the Election Rules is necessary, the Chair shall have the power to make immediate decisions, subject to later approval or reversal by the committee. Both approval and reversal shall require a simple majority vote of the committee\u201d (IV.B.1.b). (As of Feb. 26th, 2013, the ASCMC Constitution is not currently available at ascmc.org.)\u000aAlthough the Elections Committee\u2019s vote appears to be constitutional, the composition of the Elections Committee favors existing members of the Executive Board.\u000a2013  saw a close election that required precise actions by the Elections Committee. Although candidates won by slim, measurable margins, the underlying petition process proved subjective and  inconsistent.
